# Todo List for Batch 27.2: Plan Rejection Enforcement & Logging

- [ ] **Phase 1: Setup and Design**
    - [x] Analyze Batch 27.2 requirements (completed)
    - [x] Create this todo list for Batch 27.2.
    - [x] Define specific thresholds for emotion, trust, and invariants (completed as part of design)
    - [x] Design the `PlanRejector` (or `PlanComplianceChecker`) component (completed)
    - [x] Design the schema for `plan_rejection_log.json` (`plan_rejection_log.schema.json`) (completed)

- [ ] **Phase 2: Implementation**
    - [x] Implement the `plan_rejection_log.schema.json` (completed).
    - [x] Implement the `PlanRejector` class/module with logic to:
        - [x] Load selected plan details from `loop_plan_selection_log.json` for a given `loop_id` (completed).
        - [x] Retrieve/simulate current emotion state, trust score, and relevant invariant status (completed).
        - [x] Evaluate the selected plan against the defined thresholds (completed).
        - [x] If rejection criteria are met, construct the rejection log entry with all required fields (completed).
    - [x] Implement the logging mechanism to write/append to `plan_rejection_log.json` (completed as part of PlanRejector class).
    - [x] Implement a main script/function (`scripts/run_plan_rejection_check.py`) to orchestrate the rejection check for a given `loop_id` (completed).
    - [x] Prepare test data for `loop_plan_selection_log.json` (completed).
    - [x] Prepare mock data/stubs for emotion state, trust score, and invariant status to simulate various scenarios (passing and failing thresholds) (completed as part of test script setup).
    - [x] Create unit tests for the `PlanRejector` component, covering threshold evaluation and log entry creation (completed).
    - [x] Execut- [x] **Phase 4: Documentation and Manifests**
    - [x] Update `wiring_manifest.json` with the new `PlanRejector` component and `plan_rejection_log.json` data surface (completed).
    - [x] Update `file_tree.json` with all new files created (core logic, schema, log file, tests) (completed).    - [x] Generate a comprehensive report for Batch 27.2 (completed).
