Date: {datetime.now(timezone.utc).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')}

## 1. Overview

This report summarizes the work completed for Batch 27.3, which focused on implementing logic to detect scenarios where all candidate plans are rejected, log these escalations, and trigger configurable fallback mechanisms. This batch is a crucial step in enhancing the agent's robustness and decision-making capabilities when facing challenging planning situations.

## 2. Objectives

The primary objectives for Batch 27.3 were:

{read_file_content(REQUIREMENTS_PATH, '    - Objectives not found in requirements analysis file.')}

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1. Design Approach

The implementation followed the design outlined in `batch_27_3_implementation_design.md`. Key aspects included:

{read_file_content(DESIGN_PATH, '    - Design details not found in implementation design file.')}

### 3.2. Core Components Implemented

1.  **`app/schemas/plan_escalation_log.schema.json`**: Defines the structure for logging escalation events. This schema includes fields for `loop_id`, `escalation_reason`, `rejected_plan_ids`, `recommended_action`, `operator_alert_flag`, `timestamp`, and `fallback_details`.
2.  **`app/core/plan_escalation_detector.py` (`PlanEscalationDetector` class)**: This is the central component responsible for:
    *   Loading data from `multi_plan_comparison.json`, `plan_rejection_log.json`, and `loop_plan_selection_log.json` for a given `loop_id`.
    *   Determining if all candidate plans for the most recent comparison set of a loop have been rejected.
    *   Logging escalation events to `app/logs/plan_escalation_log.json` if an escalation condition is met.
    *   Triggering configurable fallback logic (e.g., attempting plan regeneration or alerting the operator) if an escalation occurs and fallback is enabled.
3.  **`scripts/run_escalation_check.py`**: An integration script that allows manual or automated execution of the escalation detection and fallback process for a specified `loop_id`. It takes the `loop_id` and an optional fallback configuration file as input.

### 3.3. Fallback Logic

The fallback logic is integrated within the `PlanEscalationDetector`'s `_trigger_fallback` method. It supports different strategies based on the provided configuration:
    *   `log_and_alert_operator`: Logs the issue and recommends operator review.
    *   `attempt_regeneration_simple`: A placeholder for future, more complex plan regeneration logic. Currently, it logs the attempt.
    The fallback mechanism can be enabled or disabled via a configuration file passed to the `run_escalation_check.py` script or through the `fallback_config` parameter of the detector.

## 4. Testing and Validation

### 4.1. Test Data

Specific test data was created in `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/test_data/batch_27_3/` to simulate various scenarios:
*   `multi_plan_comparison_loop_0050.json` & `plan_rejection_log_loop_0050_partial_rejection.json`: Scenario where not all plans are rejected (no escalation expected).
*   `multi_plan_comparison_loop_0052.json` & `plan_rejection_log_loop_0052_all_rejected.json`: Scenario where all plans for `loop_0052` are rejected (escalation expected).

### 4.2. Test Cases and Execution

Unit tests were implemented in `tests/core/test_plan_escalation_detector.py`. These tests cover:
*   Correct detection of no-escalation scenarios.
*   Correct detection of escalation scenarios (all plans rejected).
*   Proper logging to `plan_escalation_log.json`.
*   Correct triggering and behavior of fallback logic (both disabled and enabled with different strategies).
*   Handling of edge cases like missing log entries or empty candidate plan lists.

**All tests passed successfully** after an initial path correction in the test script.

## 5. Manifest Updates

Manifest files were updated to reflect the new components and data surfaces:

*   **`app/memory/wiring_manifest.json`**: An attempt was made to update this file. However, an error `KeyError: 'surface_id'` was encountered during the script execution for adding the new data surface `plan_escalation_log.json`. The component `PlanEscalationDetector` and schema `plan_escalation_log.schema.json` were intended to be added. This requires further investigation.
*   **`app/memory/file_tree.json`**: Successfully updated to include all new files created and modified during this batch.
*   **`app/memory/file_tree_plan.json`**: No direct updates were made by the script, as it's intended for planned structure. Manual review may be needed if core application structure changes significantly.

## 6. Files Created or Modified

The following files were created or significantly modified during Batch 27.3:

{chr(10).join([f'- `{f}`' for f in FILES_CREATED])}

## 7. Conclusion

Batch 27.3 successfully implemented the core logic for detecting plan escalations and triggering fallback mechanisms. The system can now identify situations where all proposed plans are unviable and take predefined actions. Testing has confirmed the functionality under various conditions. The primary outstanding issue is the error encountered during the `wiring_manifest.json` update, which needs to be resolved.
