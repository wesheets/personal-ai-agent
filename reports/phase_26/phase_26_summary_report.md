# Phase 26 Completion Summary: Emotion Drift Tracking, Refactor Triggers & Justification Compression

**Date:** May 09, 2025

## 1. Overview

Phase 26 aimed to significantly enhance the AI agent's self-awareness, emotional regulation, and long-term stability. This was achieved by implementing three key batches of functionality: tracking emotional drift based on loop outcomes, assessing the agent's awareness of this drift, and introducing a mechanism to suggest refactoring of components based on cognitive metrics and emotional state.

## 2. Batch Summaries

### 2.1. Batch 26.0: Integrate Emotion Drift Tracking

*   **Objective:** Implement logic to track and apply emotion drift to agents based on loop outcomes.
*   **Key Activities & Implementation:**
    *   Created `app/validators/track_emotion_drift.py` to handle the core logic of updating agent emotion profiles (`agent_emotion_profile.json`) and logging drift events to `emotion_drift_tracker.json`.
    *   Modified `app/controllers/loop_controller.py` to call the `track_emotion_drift` function after each loop completion, passing necessary parameters like agent ID, loop ID, outcome, regret score, and justification reference.
    *   Ensured that `agent_emotion_profile.json` and `emotion_drift_tracker.json` were correctly initialized and updated.
*   **Testing & Validation:** Successfully validated through test scripts (`run_loop_0044a_success_test.py`, `run_loop_0044b_failure_test.py`) simulating different loop outcomes. The `pydantic` dependency was installed to resolve a `ModuleNotFoundError`.
*   **Outcome:** The emotion drift tracking functionality was successfully implemented and verified. The system can now track and record changes in agent emotions based on performance.

### 2.2. Batch 26.1: Integrate Drift Awareness Assessment and Alerting

*   **Objective:** Implement logic to assess agent awareness of its emotional drift and log alerts if awareness is low.
*   **Key Activities & Implementation:**
    *   Created `app/validators/assess_drift_awareness.py` to calculate an awareness score based on current and historical emotion data.
    *   Established `app/memory/emotion_drift_alert_log.json` to store alerts when an agent's drift awareness score falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 0.3).
    *   Integrated the `assess_drift_awareness` function into `app/controllers/loop_controller.py`.
*   **Testing & Validation:** Unit tests for `assess_drift_awareness.py` passed, validating scenarios for high awareness, low awareness, and no historical data.
*   **Issues:** An `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'` occurred during the automated update of `file_tree.json`, indicating a structural mismatch. The `wiring_manifest.json` was updated successfully.
*   **Outcome:** The core functionality for drift awareness assessment and alerting was successfully implemented. The system can evaluate an agent's awareness of its emotional state changes and log alerts.

### 2.3. Batch 26.2: Implement Refactor Trigger Surface & Logic

*   **Objective:** Introduce a mechanism to suggest refactoring of agent components based on cognitive metrics like high regret scores or emotional instability.
*   **Key Activities & Implementation:**
    *   Created `app/memory/refactor_suggestion_log.json` to store refactor suggestions.
    *   Implemented `app/validators/refactor_monitor.py` with logic to generate refactor suggestions based on triggers such as high regret scores, emotional instability, or sustained high complexity.
    *   Modified `app/controllers/loop_controller.py` to integrate the refactor suggestion functionality.
*   **Testing & Validation:** Standalone tests for the refactor suggestion mechanism passed, confirming that suggestions are generated and logged correctly.
*   **Issues:** Similar to Batch 26.1, the script to update `app/memory/file_tree.json` failed due to a `TypeError` (list indices must be integers or slices, not str), indicating an ongoing issue with the file tree update process. The `wiring_manifest.json` was updated successfully.
*   **Outcome:** The core refactor suggestion functionality was successfully implemented. The system can now identify conditions warranting refactoring and log these suggestions.

## 3. Overall Phase 26 Outcome

Phase 26 successfully delivered on its objectives by implementing key features for tracking emotional drift, assessing awareness of this drift, and triggering refactor suggestions. These enhancements contribute to a more robust, self-aware, and adaptable AI agent. While the core functionalities were implemented and tested successfully, a recurring issue was identified with the automated update of the `file_tree.json` manifest, which will require further investigation and resolution in subsequent phases or maintenance activities. All batches (26.0, 26.1, 26.2) were marked as verified.

## 4. Key Files Created/Modified in Phase 26

*   `app/validators/track_emotion_drift.py`
*   `app/validators/assess_drift_awareness.py`
*   `app/validators/refactor_monitor.py`
*   `app/memory/agent_emotion_profile.json` (updated)
