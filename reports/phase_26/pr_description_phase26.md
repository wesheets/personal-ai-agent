# Phase 26 Pull Request: Emotion Drift, Awareness, and Refactor Triggers

This pull request encompasses the work completed in Phase 26, which focused on enhancing the agent's emotional intelligence and self-monitoring capabilities. It includes three main batches:

1.  **Batch 26.0: Integrate Emotion Drift Tracking:** Implemented functionality to track and apply emotion drift to agents based on loop outcomes. This involved creating `track_emotion_drift.py` and integrating it into the `loop_controller.py`. Key outputs include updates to `agent_emotion_profile.json` and `emotion_drift_tracker.json`.

2.  **Batch 26.1: Integrate Drift Awareness Assessment and Alerting:** Developed logic to assess an agent's awareness of its emotional drift and log alerts if awareness is low. This included creating `assess_drift_awareness.py` and `emotion_drift_alert_log.json`.

3.  **Batch 26.2: Implement Refactor Trigger Surface & Logic:** Introduced a mechanism to suggest refactoring of agent components based on cognitive metrics like high regret scores or emotional instability. This involved creating `refactor_monitor.py` and `refactor_suggestion_log.json`.

## Key Changes and Additions:

*   **New Validators:**
    *   `app/validators/track_emotion_drift.py`
    *   `app/validators/assess_drift_awareness.py`
    *   `app/validators/refactor_monitor.py`
*   **New Memory/Log Files:**
    *   `app/memory/emotion_drift_tracker.json`
    *   `app/memory/emotion_drift_alert_log.json`
    *   `app/memory/refactor_suggestion_log.json`
*   **Updated Memory Files:**
    *   `app/memory/agent_emotion_profile.json`
    *   `app/memory/agent_emotion_state.json`
*   **Modified Core Components:**
    *   `app/controllers/loop_controller.py` (integrated calls to new validators)
*   **New Test Scripts:** Various unit and standalone tests for the new functionalities.
*   **Updated Manifests:** `batch_26_execution_plan.locked.json` and `wiring_manifest.json` reflect the completed work.

## Issues Encountered:

A recurring issue was noted across batches 26.1 and 26.2 concerning the automated update of `file_tree.json`. This did not impede the core functionality of the implemented features but will require separate attention.

## Verification:

All core functionalities for Phase 26 have been implemented and verified through testing. The individual batch reports and the overall Phase 26 summary report are included in this bundle for detailed review.
