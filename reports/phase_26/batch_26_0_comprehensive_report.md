## Batch 26.0: Integrate Emotion Drift Tracking - Comprehensive Report

**Date:** May 09, 2025

**Objective:** Implement and verify the functionality for tracking and applying emotion drift to agents based on loop outcomes.

**Activities Completed:**

1.  **Prerequisite Check & Setup:**
    *   Cloned a fresh repository.
    *   Examined `batch_26_execution_plan.locked.json`.
    *   Checked prerequisites for Batch 26.0.
    *   Created missing `track_emotion_drift.py` file and its directory structure.

2.  **Implementation:**
    *   Implemented the `track_emotion_drift.py` script with logic to update agent emotion profiles and log drift events.
    *   Modified `loop_controller.py` to integrate the `track_emotion_drift` function, ensuring it is called after loop completion with necessary parameters (agent ID, loop ID, outcome, regret score, justification reference).
    *   Ensured `agent_emotion_profile.json` and `emotion_drift_tracker.json` are created if they do not exist and updated correctly.

3.  **Testing & Validation:**
    *   Created and executed test scripts (`run_loop_0044a_success_test.py` and `run_loop_0044b_failure_test.py`) to simulate different loop outcomes.
    *   Verified that `agent_emotion_profile.json` is updated correctly based on the success or failure of the loop.
    *   Verified that `emotion_drift_tracker.json` logs the drift events accurately.
    *   Addressed `ModuleNotFoundError` by installing the `pydantic` dependency.

4.  **Manifest & Documentation:**
    *   Updated `wiring_manifest.json`, `file_tree.json`, and `promethios_file_tree_plan.v3.1.5_runtime_synced.json` to reflect changes made during Batch 26.0.

**Outcome:**

The emotion drift tracking functionality has been successfully implemented and verified. The system can now track changes in agent emotions based on loop outcomes, and this information is logged appropriately. All planned tasks for Batch 26.0 have been completed.

**Next Steps:**

Proceed with Batch 26.1: Integrate Drift Awareness Assessment and Alerting.
