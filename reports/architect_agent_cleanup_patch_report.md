# ArchitectAgent Cleanup Patch - Validation Report

Date: 2025-05-07

## 1. Overview

This report summarizes the application and validation of the cleanup patch for the `ArchitectAgent` as per the user's directive. The objective was to ensure the `ArchitectAgent.run()` method returns an `AgentResult` object with a string status (e.g., "SUCCESS") instead of a raw dictionary or an enum for the status, to prevent downstream `AttributeError` and Pydantic validation issues.

## 2. Changes Implemented

Targeted modifications were made to `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/agents/architect_agent.py`:

1.  **Import `AgentResult`:** The `AgentResult` class was imported from `app.schemas.core.agent_result`.
2.  **Return Type Hint Update:** The `run` method's return type hint was changed from `ArchitectPlanResult` to `AgentResult`.
3.  **Return Statement Update (Success Path):** The successful return statement was modified to construct and return an `AgentResult` object, ensuring the `status` field is the string "SUCCESS" and the `output` field contains the `plan_output_dict`.
    ```python
    plan_output_dict = ArchitectPlanResult(
        # ... existing fields ...
        status=ResultStatus.SUCCESS
    ).model_dump()
    
    return AgentResult(
        status="SUCCESS",  # Changed from ResultStatus.SUCCESS
        output=plan_output_dict
    )
    ```
4.  **Return Statement Update (Failure Path):** The exception handling block was updated to return an `AgentResult` object with `status="FAILURE"` (string) and the error message in the `errors` list.
    ```python
    return AgentResult(
        status="FAILURE",  # Changed from ResultStatus.FAILURE
        errors=[str(e)]
    )
    ```

## 3. Validation with `loop_0037`

The `loop_0037` integration test was executed after applying the patch. The key validation outcomes are:

*   **No `AttributeError`:** The loop completed without any `AttributeError` related to accessing `agent_result.status` in `loop_controller.py`.
*   **No Pydantic Validation Error for `AgentResult.status`:** The `AgentResult` object passed Pydantic validation, as the `status` field now correctly uses an uppercase string value (e.g., "SUCCESS").
*   **Architect Agent Execution:** The Architect agent successfully executed, processed its payload, and saved its plan to `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/memory/proposed_plan_loop_0037.json`.
*   **Loop Identity Signature:** The loop identity signature was correctly logged in `app/memory/loop_identity_signature.json`.
*   **Downstream Agent Interaction:** The loop proceeded to the Critic agent for summary evaluation, indicating that the Architect agent's output was correctly processed.
*   **Log Cleanliness:** The execution log for `loop_0037` is clean of the previously observed `AttributeError` and Pydantic validation errors related to the Architect agent's return value.

## 4. Manifest Updates

*   The `/home/ubuntu/wiring_manifest.updated_phase22_36.json` was updated with `batch-id "23.cleanup"` to reflect these changes.

## 5. Conclusion

The cleanup patch for the `ArchitectAgent` has been successfully applied and validated. The agent now returns a schema-compliant `AgentResult` object, resolving the previously identified `AttributeError` and Pydantic validation issues. This finalizes the necessary corrections for Phase 23, and the system is now in a stable state to proceed with Phase 24 requirements.
