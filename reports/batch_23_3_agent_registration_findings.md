# Agent Registration Error Analysis and Findings

Date: 2025-05-07

## Summary

During the execution of Batch 23.3, specifically while attempting to run integration test `loop_0036a`, critical errors related to agent registration were observed. These errors prevented the loop controller from successfully loading and utilizing all intended agents, notably the 'Architect' and 'Critic' agents, which in turn likely impacted the full execution and validation of system invariant checks.

## Detailed Findings

1.  **Missing Execution Log:**
    *   The primary execution log for `loop_0036a` (`/home/ubuntu/logs/loop_0036a_execution.log`) was not found. This hindered a direct review of the loop's operational flow and error messages at the point of failure.

2.  **Empty Invariant Violation Log:**
    *   The invariant violation log (`/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/memory/invariant_violation_log.json`) was found but was empty. This indicates either no invariants were violated, or the invariant checking logic was not fully exercised due to the agent registration failures preventing normal loop operation.

3.  **Critic Agent Registration Failure - Missing Enum Members:**
    *   **File:** `app/agents/critic_agent.py`
    *   **Issue:** The `@register` decorator for the `CriticAgent` uses `AgentCapability.VALIDATION` and `AgentCapability.REJECTION`.
    *   **Root Cause:** These enum members (`VALIDATION`, `REJECTION`) are not defined in the `AgentCapability` enum within `app/core/agent_registry.py`.
    *   **Impact:** This causes an error during the import or registration phase of the `CriticAgent`, preventing it from being available in the `AGENT_REGISTRY`.

4.  **Pessimist Agent Registration Failure - Incorrect Import Path:**
    *   **File:** `app/agents/pessimist_agent.py`
    *   **Issue:** The `PessimistAgent` imports `register` and `AgentCapability` from `app.registry`.
    *   **Root Cause:** The correct location for these core components is `app.core.agent_registry`.
    *   **Impact:** This likely leads to the `PessimistAgent` not being registered in the central `AGENT_REGISTRY` used by the `loop_controller.py`, or potentially attempting to register with a different, isolated registry instance if `app.registry` somehow resolves.

## Next Steps

Based on these findings, the following corrective actions are proposed:

1.  Modify `app/core/agent_registry.py`: Add `VALIDATION = "validation"` and `REJECTION = "rejection"` to the `AgentCapability` enum.
2.  Modify `app/agents/pessimist_agent.py`: Change the import statement from `from app.registry import register, AgentCapability` to `from app.core.agent_registry import register, AgentCapability`.
3.  After implementing these fixes, rerun the integration test `loop_0036a` to validate that all agents are correctly registered and that the system invariant checks can be properly tested.
