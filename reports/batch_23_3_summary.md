# Batch 23.3 Summary

Date: 2025-05-07

## Overview

Batch 23.3 focused on implementing and validating system invariant checking within the `loop_controller.py`. This involved defining schemas for system invariants and violation logs, integrating logic to load, check, and log these invariants, and running integration tests (`loop_0036a`) to ensure the functionality.

## Key Activities and Findings

1.  **Schema and Memory Surface Creation:**
    *   Pydantic models for `SystemInvariant` (`app/schemas/system_invariants_schema.py`) and `InvariantViolationRecord` (`app/schemas/invariant_violation_log_schema.py`) were created.
    *   Corresponding memory surfaces `app/memory/system_invariants.json` and `app/memory/invariant_violation_log.json` were established.

2.  **Invariant Checking Logic Integration:**
    *   Functions `load_system_invariants`, `log_invariant_violation`, and `check_system_invariants` were added to `loop_controller.py`.
    *   This logic was integrated into the main loop flow to check invariants at appropriate points.

3.  **Agent Registration Debugging (Iterative Process):
    *   Initial runs of `loop_0036a` revealed significant issues with agent registration, preventing agents like Architect, Critic, and Pessimist from being correctly loaded and utilized. This directly impacted the ability to fully test the invariant checking under normal operational flow.
    *   **Fixes Implemented:**
        *   **`AgentCapability` Enum:** Added `VALIDATION`, `REJECTION`, and `RISK_ASSESSMENT` members to the `AgentCapability` enum in `app/core/agent_registry.py`. This resolved import/registration errors for the Critic and Pessimist agents related to these capabilities.
        *   **Pessimist Agent Import:** Corrected the import path for `register` and `AgentCapability` in `app/agents/pessimist_agent.py` to point to `app.core.agent_registry`.
        *   **Critic Agent Lookup:** Modified `loop_controller.py` to use the lowercase key `"critic"` when calling `get_agent` for the Critic agent, matching its registration key.
        *   **Architect Agent (Attempted Fix):** Added `input_schema = ArchitectInstruction` to `ArchitectAgent` in `app/agents/architect_agent.py` in an attempt to resolve payload issues. However, this did not fully fix the invocation problem.

4.  **Integration Test (`loop_0036a`) Reruns:**
    *   The `loop_0036a` test was executed multiple times to diagnose and validate fixes.
    *   The latest runs show that Critic and Pessimist agents are now being registered correctly.
    *   The Critic agent is successfully invoked for summary evaluation, and its logic (including trust score checks, which are a form of invariant) is being exercised.

5.  **Invariant Violation Log:**
    *   The `app/memory/invariant_violation_log.json` file remained empty throughout the tests. This indicates that either no defined system invariants were actually violated during the test runs, or the specific conditions required to trigger them (especially those dependent on full agent chain execution) were not met due to other pending issues.

## Current Status and Outstanding Issues

*   **Agent Registration:** Largely resolved for Critic and Pessimist agents.
*   **Invariant Checking:** The core logic is implemented and integrated. The system appears to exercise parts of this logic (e.g., trust score evaluation by Critic). However, the absence of logged violations needs further investigation in conjunction with full agent operation.
*   **Architect Agent Invocation:** This remains a **critical outstanding issue**. The `ArchitectAgent.run()` method is still being called without the required `payload` argument, leading to a runtime error. This prevents the Architect agent from executing its tasks, which in turn blocks the downstream flow and full validation of the loop, including how other agents and invariant checks would behave in response to an Architect-generated plan.
*   **Other Agent Import Errors:** The logs from `loop_0036a` still show various import errors for other agents not directly targeted in this batch (e.g., `debug_analyzer_agent`, `forge_agent`, `hal_agent`, etc., often with `unexpected indent` or `cannot import name 'Agent' from 'agent_sdk'`). While not the focus of Batch 23.3, these indicate broader issues in the agent framework that will need addressing.

## Next Steps (Beyond Batch 23.3)

1.  **Resolve Architect Agent Invocation:** Prioritize fixing the `ArchitectAgent.run()` payload issue in `loop_controller.py`.
2.  **Full Invariant Validation:** Once the Architect agent and subsequent agent chain are operational, conduct thorough testing to ensure all defined system invariants are correctly checked and violations are logged as expected.
3.  **Address Broader Agent Import Errors:** Systematically investigate and fix the remaining agent import errors to ensure a stable agent ecosystem.
