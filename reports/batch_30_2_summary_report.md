# Batch 30.2: Advanced Recovery & Escalation - Summary Report

**Date:** 2025-05-09
**Phase:** 30: Error Handling and Recovery Systems
**Batch:** 30.2: Advanced Recovery & Escalation

**1. Overview:**
This batch focused on extending the error handling framework in `loop_controller.py` to support critical error escalation and operator review gating (as a placeholder for Phase 32). The objectives included implementing logic for critical error types (e.g., `UnhandledAgentException`) to automatically log the error, write an escalation entry to `operator_escalation_queue.json`, and halt loop execution. Validation of schemas and memory surface writes for `runtime_error_log.json` and `operator_escalation_queue.json` was also a key part of this batch.

**2. Implemented Advanced Escalation Logic:**
- **Critical Error Identification:** Defined a set of critical error categories (`CriticalInvariantViolation`, `UnhandledAgentException`, `UnknownRuntimeException`, `UncaughtException`) that trigger the advanced escalation pathway.
- **Error Logging:** Upon detection of a critical error, the system first logs a detailed entry to `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/memory/runtime_error_log.json` with a "Critical" severity.
- **Operator Escalation:**
    - An escalation entry is written to `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/memory/operator_escalation_queue.json`.
    - This entry includes: `escalation_id` (UUID), `timestamp`, `loop_id`, `batch_id`, `error_id_ref` (linking to the runtime error log entry), `reason` (error type), `summary` of the issue, `recommended_operator_action`, `confidence_in_escalation_need` (set to 1.0 for these critical errors), and initial `status` as "pending_review".
- **Loop Halt (Simulated):** After logging and escalation, the loop execution is conceptually halted, with a message indicating it awaits operator review. The actual mechanism for operator input is planned for Phase 32.

**3. Simulation Results (Loop 0073):**
The `simulate_loop_0073_with_escalation` function was added to `loop_controller.py` and executed:
- **Critical Error Trigger:** The simulation successfully triggered an `UnhandledAgentException` within the `CriticalAgentCoreFunction`.
- **Logging:**
    - A "Critical" error entry was successfully logged to `runtime_error_log.json`.
    - An escalation entry with all required fields was successfully logged to `operator_escalation_queue.json`.
- **Halt:** The simulation printed a message confirming the loop halt and the (simulated) awaiting of operator review.

**4. Schema Validation and Updates:**
- **`runtime_error_log.schema.json`:**
    - Initial validation failed because the new critical error types (e.g., `UnhandledAgentException`) were not in the `error_category` enum.
    - The schema was updated to include `CriticalInvariantViolation`, `UnhandledAgentException`, and `UnknownRuntimeException` in the `error_category` enum.
    - After the update, `runtime_error_log.json` (populated by `loop_0073`) was successfully revalidated against the modified schema.
- **`operator_escalation_queue.schema.json`:**
    - This schema was reviewed and found to be sufficient for the Batch 30.2 requirements, supporting all necessary fields for the escalation entry.
    - `operator_escalation_queue.json` (populated by `loop_0073`) was successfully validated against this schema.

**5. Critical File Handling and Manifest Updates:**
- **`loop_controller.py`:** Significantly modified to include the new `CRITICAL_ERRORS_FOR_ESCALATION` list, the `log_operator_escalation` function, and the `simulate_loop_0073_with_escalation` test case.
- **`wiring_manifest.updated_phase22_36.json`:** Updated by appending new entries for:
    - The execution of `loop_0073`.
    - The modification of `loop_controller.py`.
    - The modification of `runtime_error_log.schema.json`.
    The critical file handling protocol was followed.
- **`file_tree.updated_post_phase36.json`:** Updated to reflect modifications to `loop_controller.py`, `runtime_error_log.schema.json`, `runtime_error_log.json`, and `operator_escalation_queue.json`.
- **`promethios_file_tree_plan.v3.1.5_runtime_synced.json`:** Updated consistently with the file tree.

**6. Issues Encountered and Resolutions:**
- **Schema Validation Failure:** The primary issue was the initial failure of `runtime_error_log.json` to validate against its schema due to missing new critical error types in the `error_category` enum. This was resolved by updating `runtime_error_log.schema.json` and re-validating.

**7. Conclusion:**
Batch 30.2 successfully implemented and demonstrated the advanced error escalation mechanism for critical errors. This included logging to both the standard runtime error log and the new operator escalation queue, along with a simulated halt for operator review. Schema compliance was ensured after necessary updates. All relevant manifest and file tree documents were updated, maintaining audit integrity. The system is now capable of a more robust response to critical failures, paving the way for operator intervention mechanisms in later phases.
