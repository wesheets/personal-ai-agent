# Batch 32.1 Summary Report: Implement Operator Review Gate Interface

**Phase:** 32: Operator Interface and Intervention Tools
**Batch:** 32.1
**Date:** May 09 2025

## 1. Overview

This report summarizes the activities and outcomes for Batch 32.1: Implement Operator Review Gate Interface. The primary goal was to implement the mechanism for Operator interaction with review gates, particularly those used in Phase 30 escalations. This involved modifying `loop_controller.py` to check `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/memory/operator_input.json` when paused for Operator review, ensuring decisions are logged to a new `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/memory/operator_intervention_log.json`, and creating the schema for this new log. All objectives as defined in `batch_32_execution_plan.locked.json` for Batch 32.1, including critical file handling protocols, have been met.

## 2. Key Actions Performed

1.  **Confirmed Objectives & Scope:** Thoroughly reviewed Batch 32.1 requirements from `batch_32_execution_plan.locked.json`.
2.  **Verified Operator Input Surface:** Confirmed `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/schemas/operator_input.schema.json` (v1.0) and `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/memory/operator_input.json` from Batch 32.0 were suitable.
3.  **Created Operator Intervention Log & Schema:**
    *   Developed `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/schemas/operator_intervention_log.schema.json` (v1.0) with fields: `intervention_id`, `timestamp`, `loop_id`, `batch_id`, `operator_id`, `input_ref_id`, `action_taken`, `details`, `logged_by`.
    *   Initialized `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/memory/operator_intervention_log.json` as an empty list, adhering to critical file handling.
4.  **Enhanced `loop_controller.py`:**
    *   Modified `loop_controller.py` to include `log_operator_intervention` function.
    *   Updated `simulate_loop_0076_critical_escalation` (and by extension, the new `simulate_loop_0081_review_gate_test`) to call `check_operator_input` at the simulated review gate and then log the outcome to `operator_intervention_log.json`.
    *   Updated `simulate_loop_0080_operator_input_check` to also log to `operator_intervention_log.json`.
5.  **Verified Operator Input Process:** Confirmed `submit_operator_input.py` from Batch 32.0 was suitable for providing test inputs.
6.  **Simulated and Logged Test Loops:**
    *   **loop_0081 (Review Gate Test):** Submitted an "approve" decision via `submit_operator_input.py`. Ran `loop_controller.py`. Verified that `loop_0081` (using `simulate_loop_0076_critical_escalation` logic) read the input, logged the approval to `operator_intervention_log.json`, and simulated continuation.
    *   **loop_0080_recheck_32.1 (Uncertain Justification Test):** Submitted a "reject" decision. Ran `loop_controller.py`. Verified that `loop_0080_recheck_32.1` read the input and logged the intervention to `operator_intervention_log.json`.
7.  **Updated System Manifests (Adhering to Critical File Handling):
    *   Updated `/home/ubuntu/wiring_manifest.updated_phase22_36.json` with entries for `loop_0081` and `loop_0080_recheck_32.1` using `update_wiring_manifest_32_1.py`.
    *   Updated `/home/ubuntu/file_tree.updated_post_phase36.json` with all new/modified files using `update_file_trees_32_1.py`.
    *   Updated `/home/ubuntu/promethios_file_tree_plan.v3.1.5_runtime_synced.json` using `update_file_trees_32_1.py`.
8.  **Verified Critical File Handling & Outputs:** Confirmed all critical files were handled per protocol and outputs met batch requirements. The `operator_intervention_log.json` correctly captured the simulated interventions.

## 4. Conclusion

Batch 32.1 successfully implemented the operator review gate interface. The `loop_controller.py` now checks for operator input during simulated review pauses and logs these interventions. New schemas and log files for operator interventions are in place. All system manifests have been updated, adhering to critical file handling procedures. This enhances the system's capability for operator oversight and intervention during critical loop events.
