# Batch 32.2 Summary Report: System Status Dashboard Enhancement

**Phase:** 32: Operator Interface and Intervention Tools
**Batch:** 32.2
**Date:** May 09 2025

## 1. Overview

This report summarizes the activities and outcomes for Batch 32.2: System Status Dashboard Enhancement. The primary goal was to enhance the `log_aggregator_tool.py` to display near-real-time system status metrics based on a configuration file. This included creating the necessary schema and configuration files, implementing logic to fetch and display metrics like active loops, trust scores, error counts, escalations, and drift, and ensuring the tool handles various scenarios gracefully. All objectives as defined in `batch_32_execution_plan.locked.json` for Batch 32.2, including critical file handling protocols, have been met.

## 2. Key Actions Performed

1.  **Confirmed Objectives & Scope:** Thoroughly reviewed Batch 32.2 requirements from `batch_32_execution_plan.locked.json`.
2.  **Created Operator Dashboard Config Schema & File:**
    *   Created `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/schemas/operator_dashboard_config.schema.json` (v1.0) to define the structure for dashboard configuration, including sections for log aggregation and system status metrics.
    *   Created and initialized `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/memory/operator_dashboard_config.json` with default settings for monitored logs and all specified system status metrics (active loops, trust scores, error counts, escalations, drift), adhering to critical file handling.
3.  **Created & Enhanced `log_aggregator_tool.py`:**
    *   Created `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/tools/log_aggregator_tool.py` from scratch as it was found to be missing.
    *   Implemented functions to read and process data from relevant memory surfaces (`loop_summary.json`, `agent_trust_score.json`, `runtime_error_log.json`, `operator_escalation_queue.json`, `legacy_alignment_tracker.json`, `operator_intervention_log.json`) to gather data for the dashboard metrics.
    *   Ensured the tool reads its configuration from `operator_dashboard_config.json`.
4.  **Implemented Real-Time Status Display Logic:**
    *   The tool was implemented with a main loop that periodically clears the screen and refreshes the displayed metrics and log tails, providing a near-real-time CLI dashboard experience.
    *   Implemented robust error handling for missing or empty log/metric source files, ensuring the dashboard displays "N/A" or "No entries found" rather than crashing.
5.  **Validated Enhanced Dashboard Tool:**
    *   Prepared and loaded sample data into all relevant memory surface files (`loop_summary.json`, `agent_trust_score.json`, `runtime_error_log.json`, `operator_escalation_queue.json`, `legacy_alignment_tracker.json`).
    *   Ran `log_aggregator_tool.py` and verified that it correctly displayed all key system status metrics and log tails based on the sample data and the `operator_dashboard_config.json`.
6.  **Updated System Manifests (Adhering to Critical File Handling):
    *   Updated `/home/ubuntu/wiring_manifest.updated_phase22_36.json` with an entry for the dashboard enhancement activities using `update_wiring_manifest_32_2.py`.
    *   Updated `/home/ubuntu/file_tree.updated_post_phase36.json` with all new/modified files (including schemas, configs, the tool, and sample data files) using `update_file_trees_32_2.py`.
    *   Updated `/home/ubuntu/promethios_file_tree_plan.v3.1.5_runtime_synced.json` using `update_file_trees_32_2.py`.
7.  **Verified Critical File Handling & Outputs:** Confirmed all critical files were handled per protocol and outputs met batch requirements. The dashboard tool displayed metrics correctly.

## 4. Conclusion

Batch 32.2 successfully created and enhanced the system status dashboard capabilities via the `log_aggregator_tool.py`. The tool now provides a configurable, near-real-time CLI view of key system metrics and log tails, improving operator visibility into the agent's status. All necessary schemas, configuration files, and system manifests have been updated in compliance with critical file handling protocols.
