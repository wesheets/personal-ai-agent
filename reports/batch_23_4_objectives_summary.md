# Batch 23.4 Objectives Summary

**Overall Goal:** Implement a loop identity signature mechanism and finalize all agent output enforcement mechanisms within the Promethios system.

**Key Objectives:**

1.  **Implement Loop Identity Signature:**
    *   **Create New Memory Surface & Schema:** Develop `app/memory/loop_identity_signature.json` and its corresponding Pydantic schema `app/schemas/loop_identity_signature.schema.json` to store unique signatures for each loop execution.
    *   **Signature Generation in Loop Controller:** Modify `app/controllers/loop_controller.py` to generate a unique signature at the beginning of each loop. This signature should be derived from key inputs or configurations of the loop (e.g., loop ID, intent, initial parameters).
    *   **Logging Signature:** Ensure the generated signature is logged to `app/memory/loop_identity_signature.json` following the critical file handling protocol (load full, append, save full).

2.  **Finalize and Verify Enforcement Mechanisms:**
    *   **Comprehensive Review:** Conduct a thorough review of all existing agent output enforcement checks. This includes:
        *   Truth Manifest adherence.
        *   Schema Conformance for agent inputs/outputs.
        *   Auto-Wiring Reflection logging (updates to `wiring_manifest.updated_phase22_36.json`).
        *   The newly implemented Loop Identity Signature logging.
    *   **Robust Integration:** Ensure these enforcement mechanisms are robustly integrated into all relevant stages of the `loop_controller.py` and are triggered during all pertinent agent interactions.
    *   **Logging Verification:** Confirm that all enforcement actions, checks, and any violations are appropriately logged.

3.  **Integration Testing:**
    *   **New Test Loop:** Develop and execute a new comprehensive integration test loop, designated `loop_0037`.
    *   **Exercise All Mechanisms:** This test loop must be designed to exercise all the enforcement mechanisms, including the new loop identity signature.

4.  **Functional Validation:**
    *   **Signature Verification:** Confirm that the loop identity signature is correctly generated and logged for each execution of `loop_0037`.
    *   **Enforcement Mechanism Verification:** Verify that all enforcement mechanisms (Truth Manifest, Schema Conformance, Auto-Wiring, Loop Identity) are functioning as expected and that their activities and any triggered violations are correctly logged.

5.  **Standard Procedures:**
    *   **Log Wiring:** Adhere to standard procedures for logging wiring information, ensuring `wiring_manifest.updated_phase22_36.json` is correctly populated.
    *   **Critical File Handling:** Strictly follow the non-negotiable instructions for handling critical files (load full, append/merge schema-conformantly, save entire file). This applies to `loop_identity_signature.json` and other specified logs/memory surfaces.
    *   **File Output Formalization:** Ensure outputs for `wiring_manifest.updated_phase22_36.json`, `file_tree.updated_post_phase36.json`, and `promethios_file_tree_plan.v3.1.5_runtime_synced.json` meet the specified formatting and content requirements for Batch 23.4.

**Dependencies:**
*   Successful completion and verification of Batch 23.3 (`verified: true`).
