# Batch 15.33 Validation Summary

**Objective:** Scaffold system-facing UI components for loop activation (`SystemAcknowledgeButton.jsx`, `loop_status.js`, `useLoopStatus.js`).

**Execution Steps & Outcomes:**

1.  **Environment Setup:** Successfully removed previous directory and cloned the latest repository.
2.  **Repository Structure Anomaly:**
    *   Initial verification failed: `/app/ui/` directory was missing.
    *   Recovery: Created `/app/ui/` and subdirectories (`components`, `constants`, `hooks`, `store`).
    *   Reported anomaly to Operator.
    *   Re-verification confirmed structure is now correct.
3.  **Truth Validation:**
    *   `validate_truth_surface.py` was not found.
    *   Fallback script `validate_file_tree_truth_v2.py` initially failed due to the known `SyntaxError` (unterminated string literal).
    *   Corrected the syntax error in `validate_file_tree_truth_v2.py`.
    *   Fallback validation re-run successfully. Result: `verified: true`, `safe_to_run: true`. Noted 1003 untracked files (expected `node_modules`).
4.  **Component Scaffolding:**
    *   Created placeholder scaffold for `app/ui/components/SystemAcknowledgeButton.jsx` with pessimism simulation comments.
    *   Created placeholder scaffold for `app/ui/constants/loop_status.js` with pessimism simulation comments.
    *   Created placeholder scaffold for `app/ui/hooks/useLoopStatus.js` with pessimism simulation comments.
5.  **Static Validation (ESLint):**
    *   Resolved frontend dependencies (`pnpm install`).
    *   Installed `@eslint/js` in frontend directory.
    *   Initial ESLint run failed (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package '@eslint/js'`).
    *   Troubleshooting confirmed the root-level dependency issue.
    *   Installed `@eslint/js`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` at the repository root.
    *   Second ESLint run reported one error: `no-unused-vars` for `useEffect` in `useLoopStatus.js`.
    *   Resolved error by commenting out the unused `useEffect` import.
    *   Final ESLint run completed successfully.
6.  **Wiring Log:** Executed `log_wiring_to_manifest.py` for all three scaffolded components.
7.  **Execution Plan Update:**
    *   Created `update_plan_15_33.py`.
    *   Initial execution failed due to `SyntaxError` in the script.
    *   Corrected the syntax error.
    *   Re-executed script successfully, setting `verified: true` for Batch 15.33 in `batch_15_execution_plan.json`.

**Overall Status:** Completed successfully after recovering from a missing directory structure, resolving validation script errors, troubleshooting ESLint configuration, and fixing a plan update script error.
