PHASE 3.1 ENDPOINT HEALTH VERIFICATION PLANNING - COMPLETION LOG
===============================================================

Date: April 27, 2025
Time: 15:19:36 UTC

TASK SUMMARY:
-------------
Created architectural design plan for Phase 3.1 Endpoint Health Verification System.

DELIVERABLES COMPLETED:
----------------------
1. Created planning document at /docs/planning/phase_3_1_endpoint_health_plan.md
   - Defined purpose of Endpoint Health Verification
   - Listed validation targets (critical API endpoints)
   - Specified expected response checks (status codes, payload validation, response times)
   - Designed proposed tool structure (endpoint_validator.py)
   - Specified drift reporting output format (endpoint_drift_report_YYYYMMDD.json)

PLANNING DOCUMENT SECTIONS:
--------------------------
1. Purpose of Endpoint Health Verification
   - Proactive issue detection
   - SLA compliance monitoring
   - Drift detection
   - System reliability enhancement
   - Quality assurance
   - Performance monitoring

2. Validation Targets
   - Core Agent API Endpoints
   - Knowledge Base Endpoints
   - Tool Integration Endpoints
   - Authentication and User Management
   - System Administration
   - External Integration Points

3. Expected Response Checks
   - Status Code Validation
   - Response Payload Validation
   - Response Time Metrics
   - Authentication and Authorization
   - Content and Encoding
   - Functional Validation

4. Proposed Tool Structure
   - Modular design for endpoint_validator.py
   - Configuration management
   - Validation logic
   - Reporting capabilities
   - Command-line interface

5. Drift Reporting Format
   - JSON-based reporting structure
   - Comprehensive metadata
   - Detailed endpoint validation results
   - Performance metrics
   - Historical comparison

CONSTRAINTS OBSERVED:
--------------------
- No live endpoint testing was performed
- Planning document only - execution pending Operator review

NEXT STEPS:
----------
- Await Operator review of planning document
- Prepare for implementation phase based on approved plan
- Set up configuration files and JSON schemas for validation
- Develop the endpoint_validator.py tool as specified
