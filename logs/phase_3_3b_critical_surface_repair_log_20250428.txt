# Phase 3.3-B Critical Surface Repair Log

**Date:** 2025-04-28

**Task:** Perform critical surface patch operations (MemoryRead Schema + Drift Router Syntax Fix) to restore cognitive routing integrity.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Repaired `memory_read_schema.py`:**
    *   File: `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/schemas/memory/memory_read_schema.py`
    *   Action: Added the minimal working `MemoryReadRequest` schema as specified, with memory tag `phase3.3b_critical_surface_patch`.

2.  **Repaired `drift_routes.py` Syntax Error:**
    *   File: `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/routes/drift_routes.py`
    *   Action: Corrected the syntax error by removing incorrectly placed import statements within a `try` block.

3.  **Checked `drifthealing_schemas.py`:**
    *   File: `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/schemas/drift_healing_schemas.py`
    *   Action: Verified that the `DriftHealingRequest` schema already exists as required.

**Validation Result:**

*   **Local Boot Test:** FAILED
*   **Reason:** While the two specified repairs were implemented successfully, the Uvicorn server failed to start due to an unrelated error encountered during boot:
    *   `SyntaxError: expected 'except' or 'finally' block` in `app/routes/plan_routes.py` (related to `from .schemas.planchain_schemas import PlanChainRequest`).
    *   An earlier `ImportError` related to `MemoryReadRequestSchema` from `memory_read_request_schema.py` was also noted, suggesting potential inconsistencies in how schemas are named or imported, although the primary boot failure was the `SyntaxError`.

**Conclusion:**

The two critical surface repairs requested in the task prompt (MemoryReadRequest schema and drift_routes.py syntax) were successfully implemented. However, the system still fails to boot cleanly due to a pre-existing or newly surfaced `SyntaxError` in `plan_routes.py`. Further investigation and repair are required to achieve full bootability, as per the operator's directive to approve post-fix boot results before proceeding.
