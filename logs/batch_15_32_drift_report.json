      "resolution": "Troubleshooting revealed the dependency was installed in `/app/frontend/node_modules` but ESLint expected it in the root `/node_modules`. Installed `@eslint/js` and related plugins (`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`) at the repository root using `pnpm add -D`."
