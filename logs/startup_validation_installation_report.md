- `/system/status.json` - Updated with validation installation details
- `/system/system_manifest.json` - Created to document Phase 2.1 completion

## Operator Directive Implementation
As directed, the installation:
- Accepted current drift as "Baseline Surface Drift v1.0"
- Treated current drift report as official starting point for future healing
- Performed no automatic repairs
- Maintained full transparency with all surface issues documented
- Preserved Operator governance as sole authority for approving repairs

## Phase 2.1 Completion Status
Phase 2.1 (Startup Surface Validation) has been successfully completed with the following components:
- ✅ Validation System
- ✅ Drift Detection
- ✅ Health Scoring
- ✅ Memory Tagging

## System Readiness for Phase 2.2
The Promethios system is now ready for Phase 2.2 with:
- Baseline drift established and documented
- Validation system fully operational
- Memory surfaces properly tagged
- System status and manifest updated

## Important Notes
- No automatic repairs were performed during installation
- No memory surface mutations beyond logging and tagging
- All 421 drift issues have been documented for future healing phases
- Operator remains sole authority for approving or repairing any surfaced drift

This report confirms the successful installation of the Startup Surface Validation system with Baseline Drift Acceptance as directed by the Operator.
