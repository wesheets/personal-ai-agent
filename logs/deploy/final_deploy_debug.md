# Deployment Debug Report

## Overview
This diagnostic report documents deployment issues identified in the Personal AI Agent system and the fixes implemented to resolve them. The system was experiencing deployment failures on Railway or Vercel platforms due to several configuration issues.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Port Configuration Issue
**Problem**: The application was hardcoding port 8000 in `input_gateway.py` instead of reading from the PORT environment variable.

**Impact**: Railway and other cloud platforms dynamically assign ports through environment variables. Hardcoded ports prevent the application from binding to the correct port assigned by the platform.

**Location**: 
```python
# in app/core/input_gateway.py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    # Explicitly set port to 8000 for consistency across environments
    port = 8000
    logger.info(f"Starting server on port {port}")
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=port)
```

### 2. Route Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Mismatches between how routes are registered in the backend and how they're called from the frontend.

**Impact**: Frontend requests fail to reach the correct backend endpoints, resulting in 404 errors.

**Inconsistencies Found**:
- `delegate_stream.py` registers "/delegate-stream" (without "/api" prefix)
- `main.py` has a direct route for "/api/delegate-stream"
- Frontend code uses both "/api/agent/delegate" and "/api/delegate-stream"

### 3. CORS Configuration
**Problem**: CORS configuration is too restrictive, using a regex pattern that only allows Vercel deploys and the Promethios domain.

**Impact**: Requests from development environments or other deployment platforms are blocked by CORS restrictions.

**Current Configuration**:
```python
# Production CORS middleware with regex pattern to allow only Vercel deploys and Promethios domain
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origin_regex=r"https://(.*\.vercel\.app|promethios\.ai)",
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Port Configuration Fix
Modified `input_gateway.py` to read the port from environment variables with a fallback to 8000:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    import os
    
    # Read port from environment variable with fallback to 8000
    port = int(os.getenv("PORT", 8000))
    logger.info(f"Starting server on port {port}")
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=port)
```

### 2. Route Consistency Fix
Updated `delegate_stream.py` to use consistent route prefixes:

```python
# Changed from:
@router.post("/delegate-stream")
# To:
@router.post("/api/delegate-stream")
```

And ensured all routes are properly registered in `main.py`.

### 3. CORS Configuration Fix
Modified CORS configuration to be more inclusive while maintaining security:

```python
# Updated CORS middleware to allow more origins
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origin_regex=r"https://(.*\.vercel\.app|.*\.railway\.app|promethios\.ai)|http://localhost:[0-9]+",
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

### 4. Environment Health Check
Added a new endpoint at `/api/env/health` that provides comprehensive environment information for debugging deployment issues:

- Environment variables (sanitized)
- System information
- Python version
- Deployment platform detection
- Request information
- Critical environment variable checks
- Port configuration

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set in the Railway dashboard:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (if using custom domains)
   - Other API keys as needed

2. **Build Command**: Use the following build command to ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install psycopg2-binary email-validator
   ```

3. **Start Command**: Use the following start command to properly launch the application:
   ```
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```

4. **Health Check URL**: Configure the health check URL to `/health` or `/` as both endpoints are implemented in the application.

## Conclusion
The deployment issues were primarily related to port configuration, route inconsistencies, and CORS settings. The implemented fixes address these issues while adding better diagnostic capabilities through the environment health check endpoint. These changes should resolve the deployment failures on Railway and Vercel platforms.
