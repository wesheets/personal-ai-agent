  "review_target": "Batch 15.0.C Prompt - Schema Wrapping & Agent Governance",
  "schema_wrapping_enforced": true,
  "agent_governance_rules_enforced": true,
  "evaluation": {
    "schema_wrapping": "The proposal for mandatory schema wrapping, combined with runtime validation, manifest tracking, build prompt checks, and the Pessimist enhancements (requiring schemas in PRs, default unverified status, pre-merge hooks), provides a robust framework for enforcement.",
    "agent_governance": "The principle of rule parity is sound. Enforcing it through the truth manifest, verified markers, build declarations, functional validation, traceable outputs, the `requires_validation` flag in the registry, and loop summary audits creates multiple layers of checks."
  },
  "recommended_enforcement_points": [
    "final_truth_surface_manifest.json (To declare canonical schema paths and governance flags)",
    "agent_registry.py (To store the `requires_validation: true` flag per agent)",
    "batch_15_execution_plan.json (To mandate build steps, `verified` status tracking, validation calls, and registry updates)",
    "validate_functional_surface.py (For runtime/post-build validation, including schema link checks)",
    "Git Hooks (e.g., pre-commit, pre-push) (To enforce schema inclusion/validation before merge)",
    "Loop Summary / Audit Logs (For post-hoc analysis of agent compliance during operation)"
  ],
  "additional_suggestions": [
    "Explicitly adopt Pessimist Enhancements: Agent PRs require schema files; `requires_validation: true` in agent registry; Loop summaries audit agent output compliance.",
    "Add specific batch(es) in `batch_15_execution_plan.json` to build/update `agent_registry.py` with the `requires_validation` flag for all agents.",
    "Define a standardized logging format/schema for agents to declare actions, justifications, batch IDs, and generated artifacts to facilitate automated audits.",
    "Enhance `validate_functional_surface.py` to explicitly check for the presence and validity of schema links declared in the manifest for relevant component types."
  ],
  "conclusion": "The proposed governance and schema wrapping rules, along with the enforcement mechanisms and Pessimist enhancements, establish a strong foundation for safe recursive builds. Implementing these through the recommended enforcement points is crucial."
