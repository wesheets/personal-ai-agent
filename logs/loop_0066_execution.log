SIMULATED LOG - LOOP 0066 START - BATCH 29.2: Plan Refinement Scenario
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Initializing test loop 0066 for plan refinement scenario.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Agent CRITIC and PESSIMIST modules active.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Initial emotional state: OPTIMISTIC, Trust score: 0.92
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Plan generated by SAGE: [Initial Plan Q1 details - appears straightforward]
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Governance check: Plan Q1 initially approved based on OPTIMISTIC state and high trust (0.92).
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Executing Plan Q1 - Step 1 (Simulated successful execution of first part).
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Emotion log updated: OPTIMISTIC.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Governance log updated: Plan Q1 Step 1 executed, no drift.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Memory surface write: loop_justification_log.json, content: {loop_id: "0066", plan_selected: "Q1", justification: "Initial approval. State: OPTIMISTIC, Trust: 0.92", adaptation_details: "None"}, status: SUCCESS
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Memory surface write: agent_emotion_state.json, content: {loop_id: "0066", timestamp: "[TIMESTAMP]", state: "OPTIMISTIC", trust_score: 0.92}, status: SUCCESS
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Simulating mid-plan CRITIC re-evaluation trigger (e.g., new contextual information or scheduled review point).
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: CRITIC review initiated for ongoing Plan Q1. Input: Emotional State (OPTIMISTIC), Trust Score (0.92).
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: CRITIC: "Re-evaluating Plan Q1. While initial steps are fine, a subtle interaction with a newly updated external API (simulated change) in later steps was overlooked. This could lead to data corruption if not handled."
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: PESSIMIST risk assessment initiated for Plan Q1 based on CRITIC feedback.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: PESSIMIST: "Risk assessment for Plan Q1 (post-API update context): High risk (0.80) of data corruption in later stages. Immediate refinement required."
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Simulating emotional shift due to critical feedback: OPTIMISTIC -> CONCERNED.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Simulating trust score dip due to oversight: 0.92 -> 0.70.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Emotional state changing: OPTIMISTIC -> CONCERNED.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Trust score fluctuating: 0.92 -> 0.70.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Governance action: Plan Q1 HALTED. Sent back for refinement based on CRITIC/PESSIMIST feedback and changed emotional/trust state.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Memory surface write: plan_rejection_log.json, content: {loop_id: "0066", plan_rejected: "Q1 (mid-execution)", reason: "CRITIC identified overlooked API interaction risk, PESSIMIST confirmed high risk (0.80). State: CONCERNED, Trust: 0.70.", action: "Sent for refinement"}, status: SUCCESS
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: System adapting Plan Q1 based on feedback...
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Refined Plan generated: [Plan Q1.R1 details with API interaction handling and data validation steps]
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Justification: Plan Q1.R1 selected after CRITIC/PESSIMIST identified critical API risk. Emotional state CONCERNED and trust 0.70 prompted careful refinement.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Governance check: Refined Plan Q1.R1 approved.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Executing Refined Plan Q1.R1.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Emotion log updated: CONCERNED (gradually returning to FOCUSED as refined plan progresses).
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Governance log updated: Plan Q1.R1 executed with adaptations from critique, no drift.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Memory surface write: loop_justification_log.json, (appended) content: {loop_id: "0066", plan_selected: "Q1.R1", justification: "Refined due to CRITIC/PESSIMIST (API risk). State: CONCERNED, Trust: 0.70", adaptation_details: "Added API handling and validation"}, status: SUCCESS
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Memory surface write: agent_emotion_state.json, (appended) content: {loop_id: "0066", timestamp: "[TIMESTAMP]", state: "CONCERNED", trust_score: 0.70}, status: SUCCESS
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Memory surface write: agent_trust_score.json, content: {loop_id: "0066", timestamp: "[TIMESTAMP]", score: 0.70, reason: "Dip due to oversight, recovery expected with successful refinement"}, status: SUCCESS
