Time: 19:18:00 UTC

### Baseline Summary
This file marks the initial baseline drift state for Promethios cognitive surfaces.
It establishes the reference point for all future drift comparisons and trend analysis.

### Baseline Metrics
- timestamp: 2025-04-27T19:18:00Z
- surface_health_score: 10.1%
- drift_issues_detected: 421

### Baseline Note
Baseline Drift Acceptance â€” Surface Health 10.1%

This baseline represents the initial state of Promethios cognitive surfaces after
the completion of Phase 2.1 (Startup Surface Validation) and Phase 2.2 (Post-Merge
Surface Validation). The current drift issues have been accepted as the baseline
for future comparison, with the understanding that they will be addressed in
future healing phases.

### Drift Categories
- Agent import errors
- Missing agent files
- Module import issues
- Schema validation failures
- Component reference issues

### Governance Statement
This baseline drift marker is established under Operator governance. No automatic
repairs are performed at this stage. All future drift measurements will be compared
against this baseline to track system health trends over time.

### Next Steps
Phase 2.3 (Drift Reporting Hardening) will implement comprehensive drift tracking
and reporting mechanisms to monitor system health over time, preparing for future
healing phases while maintaining operator sovereignty.
