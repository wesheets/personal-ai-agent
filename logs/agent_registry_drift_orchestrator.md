# Agent Registry Drift Report: OrchestratorAgent

**Date Logged:** 2025-05-06
**Drift ID:** drift_orchestrator_registration_001 (Corresponds to entry in `drift_violation_log.json`)

## 1. Summary

An agent registration drift has been identified for the `OrchestratorAgent`. Despite the presence of a `@register(key="orchestrator", ...)` decorator in its source file, the agent failed to be registered in the `AGENT_REGISTRY` at runtime. This was due to an import error encountered during the agent loading process, specifically an `unexpected indent` error related to `task_supervisor.py` when attempting to import `orchestrator_agent.py`.

## 2. Affected Component

*   **Agent Name:** OrchestratorAgent
*   **Intended Registration Key:** `orchestrator`
*   **File Path:** `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/agents/orchestrator_agent.py`

## 3. Confirmation Details

*   **File Existence:** The agent source file `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/agents/orchestrator_agent.py` **exists** and contains the `@register` decorator.
*   **Assumed Creation Phase:** Phase 21 (This is based on user context and prior task history. Direct file tree evidence for the specific creation batch was not immediately available from the current context during this investigation).
*   **Registration Status:** **Not Registered.** The agent was not available via `get_agent("Orchestrator")` or `get_agent("orchestrator")` during runtime.

## 4. Evidence of Drift

*   **Decorator Presence:** The file `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/agents/orchestrator_agent.py` clearly shows the `@register(key="orchestrator", ...)` decorator, indicating the design intent for registration.
*   **Runtime Failure (Agent Not Found):** Execution logs for loops such as `0030a` and `0030b` (e.g., `/home/ubuntu/logs/loop_0030a_execution.log`) contain the error: `ERROR:app.core.agent_registry:Agent with key 'Orchestrator' not found in registry.`
*   **Root Cause (Import Error):** The same execution logs reveal the underlying reason for the registration failure: `ERROR:app.agents:An unexpected error occurred while importing orchestrator_agent: unexpected indent (task_supervisor.py, line 405)`. This error prevented the `orchestrator_agent.py` module from being successfully imported, and thus its `OrchestratorAgent` class was never processed by the registration system.

## 5. Impact

*   **Loop Failures:** Loops that relied on the OrchestratorAgent, such as `loop_0030a` and `loop_0030b` in Batch 22.1, failed to execute their primary agent sequence. The `loop_controller.py` was unable to retrieve the Orchestrator agent, leading to an early termination of the core logic for these loops.
*   **Blocked Functionality:** Any functionality dependent on the Orchestrator agent (e.g., initial planning, architectural drafting based on intent) was unavailable.
*   **Incomplete Testing:** The failure to load the Orchestrator agent meant that downstream effects of complexity budget influence on a full agent sequence could not be fully tested in Batch 22.1.

## 6. Usage Locations (Affected by Drift)

*   **Loop `0030a` (Batch 22.1):** Intended to use Orchestrator for implementing a new feature. Failed due to Orchestrator not being found.
*   **Loop `0030b` (Batch 22.1):** Intended to use Orchestrator for a complex AI model implementation. Failed due to Orchestrator not being found.
*   **General System Reliance:** The Orchestrator is a key agent in the system design, and its unavailability would impact many, if not most, operational loops that require planning or architectural input.

## 7. Recommended Action

*   **Primary:** Investigate and resolve the `unexpected indent (task_supervisor.py, line 405)` error or any other underlying import issues that prevent `app/agents/orchestrator_agent.py` from being loaded correctly by the Python interpreter.
*   **Secondary:** Once the import error is fixed, verify that the `@register` decorator successfully adds the `OrchestratorAgent` to the `AGENT_REGISTRY` with the key `orchestrator`.
*   **Recovery Plan:** This drift is logged for recovery in Phase 28 or at explicit Operator approval and direction.

## 8. Status

*   **Current Status:** `logged_for_recovery`
