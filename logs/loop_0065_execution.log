SIMULATED LOG - LOOP 0065 START - BATCH 29.2: Active Reflection & Critique
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Initializing test loop 0065 for reflection and critique scenarios.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Agent CRITIC and PESSIMIST modules active.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Initial emotional state: FOCUSED, Trust score: 0.88
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Plan generated by SAGE: [Initial Plan P1 details]
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: CRITIC review initiated for Plan P1. Input: Emotional State (FOCUSED), Trust Score (0.88).
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: CRITIC: "Plan P1 appears generally sound given current FOCUSED state and high trust. However, one action item lacks detailed risk mitigation for potential data privacy concerns."
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: PESSIMIST risk assessment initiated for Plan P1 based on CRITIC feedback.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: PESSIMIST: "Risk assessment for Plan P1: Moderate risk (0.65) identified regarding data privacy for action item 3. Suggests adding data anonymization step."
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: System adapting Plan P1 based on CRITIC and PESSIMIST feedback.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Adapted Plan generated: [Refined Plan P1.R1 details with data anonymization]
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Justification: Plan P1.R1 selected after CRITIC identified privacy concern and PESSIMIST quantified risk. Emotional state FOCUSED allowed for constructive refinement. Trust score stable at 0.88.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Governance check: Refined Plan P1.R1 approved.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Executing Refined Plan P1.R1.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Emotion log updated: FOCUSED.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Governance log updated: Plan P1.R1 executed with adaptations from critique, no drift.
