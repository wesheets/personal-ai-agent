## 🧠 Manus Mission Zero – System Diagnostic Report

### ✅ Passed
- /app/core/boot.py startup success - Core.Forge initializes and executes properly
- Core.run dispatches to all agents successfully
- Memory layer handles LOG: and SHOW commands correctly
- Vertical agents (lifetree, sitegen, neureal) return valid responses
- Full system loop confirmed: Core → Agent → Output → Memory

### ⚠️ Issues Detected
- Backend routing has inconsistent API usage (direct OpenAI import vs OpenAIProvider)
- Delegate-stream route has minimal input validation
- Core logic lacks comprehensive error handling
- Agent modules return static strings only with no actual functionality
- Memory agent doesn't handle JSON logs well (no specific parsing for structured data)
- Frontend has duplicate AgentChat.jsx implementations with inconsistent features
- Environment variables accessed inconsistently (os.getenv vs os.environ.get)
- API keys potentially exposed in frontend code

### 🧠 Suggested Fixes for Agents
- Standardize agent ID naming convention in run.py (currently mixes hyphenated and non-hyphenated IDs)
- Add input validation and error handling to all agent handlers
- Implement actual functionality for vertical agents instead of template responses
- Core.Forge should implement memory integration directly instead of using print statements
- Move AGENT_PERSONALITIES to a shared configuration file
- Create comprehensive .env.example file documenting all required variables

### 🪵 Memory Entries Added
- "LOG: Manus executed final system audit. Status: STABLE"
