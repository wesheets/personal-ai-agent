# Batch 15.32 Validation Summary

**Objective:** Build or verify the component `app/ui/components/SystemAcknowledgmentsViewer.jsx`.

**Execution Steps & Outcomes:**

1.  **Environment Setup:** Successfully removed previous directory and cloned the latest repository.
2.  **Truth Validation:**
    *   `validate_truth_surface.py` was not found.
    *   Fallback script `validate_file_tree_truth_v2.py` initially failed due to a `SyntaxError` (unterminated string literal).
    *   The syntax error in `validate_file_tree_truth_v2.py` was corrected.
    *   Fallback validation re-run successfully. Result: `verified: true`, `safe_to_run: true`. Noted 1003 files present on disk but not tracked in the plan (likely `node_modules`). No critical files missing or field mismatches.
3.  **Component Scaffolding:** Created placeholder scaffold for `app/ui/components/SystemAcknowledgmentsViewer.jsx` as per instructions, including pessimistic risk comments.
4.  **Static Validation (ESLint):**
    *   Initial run failed (missing `eslint` package).
    *   Confirmed installation (`y`).
    *   Second run failed (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package '@eslint/js'`).
    *   Attempted to resolve by running `pnpm install` in `/app/frontend`.
    *   Third run failed with the same `@eslint/js` error.
    *   Troubleshooting: Verified `eslint.config.js` and checked `node_modules`. Found `@eslint/js` was missing from the root `node_modules`.
    *   Installed `@eslint/js`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` at the repository root (`/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent`).
    *   Fourth run completed successfully (no output indicates no errors).
5.  **Wiring Log:** Executed `log_wiring_to_manifest.py` for Batch 15.32.
6.  **Execution Plan Update:** Created and executed `update_plan_15_32.py` to set `verified: true` for Batch 15.32 in `batch_15_execution_plan.json`.

**Overall Status:** Completed successfully after resolving validation script and ESLint configuration issues.
