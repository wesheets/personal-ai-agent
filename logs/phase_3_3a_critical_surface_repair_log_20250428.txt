# Phase 3.3-A Critical Surface Repair Log

**Date:** 2025-04-28

**Task:** Perform critical surface repair tasks to restore core cognitive system bootability.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Repaired `system_manifest.py`:**
    *   File: `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/core/system_manifest.py`
    *   Action: Added the required stub function `register_loaded_routes(app)` as specified.

2.  **Repaired `memory_get_schema.py`:**
    *   File: `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/schemas/memory/memory_get_schema.py`
    *   Action: Added the minimal working `MemoryGetRequest` schema as specified, with memory tag `phase3.3a_critical_surface_repair`.

3.  **Repaired `reflection_routes.py` Import Error:**
    *   File: `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/routes/reflection_routes.py`
    *   Action: Corrected the import statement for `ReflectionChainRequest` and `ReflectionChainResponse`, removing the incorrect relative path.

**Validation Result:**

*   **Local Boot Test:** FAILED
*   **Reason:** While the three specified repairs were implemented successfully, the Uvicorn server failed to start due to unrelated errors encountered during boot:
    *   `ImportError: cannot import name 'MemoryReadRequest' from 'app.schemas.memory.memory_read_schema'` (encountered in `app/main.py` when loading core routers).
    *   `SyntaxError: expected 'except' or 'finally' block` in `app/routes/drift_routes.py` (related to `from .schemas.drifthealing_schemas import DriftHealingRequest`).

**Conclusion:**

The three critical surface repairs requested in the task prompt were successfully implemented. However, the system still fails to boot cleanly due to pre-existing or newly surfaced issues unrelated to these specific fixes. Further investigation and repair are required to achieve full bootability, as per the operator's directive to approve post-fix boot results before proceeding.
