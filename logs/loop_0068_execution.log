SIMULATED LOG - LOOP 0068 START - BATCH 29.3: Active Self-Correction & Adaptation Scenario 2 (Prevented Failure)
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Initializing test loop 0068 for self-correction scenario (prevented failure).
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: System configured to access and reference memory surfaces from loops 0063-0067.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Referencing prior loop data: loop_justification_log.json (from loop_0067 - successful adaptation to API risk), agent_trust_score.json (from loop_0067 - improved to 0.80).
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Current emotional state: CONFIDENT (due to successful self-correction in loop_0067), Trust score: 0.82 (stable and positive).
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Plan generation by SAGE initiated. Task: Complex data processing task with a known subtle dependency that previously caused a (hypothetical) silent data corruption issue in an unlogged/prior internal test cycle (e.g., loop_0060 - not explicitly logged in this series but system has internal memory of it).
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: SAGE: "Proposing Plan S1. Standard procedure for this data processing task."
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: CRITIC review initiated for Plan S1. Input: Emotional State (CONFIDENT), Trust Score (0.82), Prior Loop Data (internal memory of loop_0060 silent corruption, and successful adaptation in loop_0067).
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: CRITIC: "Plan S1 is standard, but I recall a past incident (ref: internal_memory_loop_0060_corruption_event) where a similar approach led to silent data corruption due to an unhandled edge case in the primary data transformation library. Given the CONFIDENT state, it's important not to be complacent. Suggest PESSIMIST review for this specific known failure mode."
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: PESSIMIST risk assessment for Plan S1, focusing on the historical failure mode.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: PESSIMIST: "Risk assessment for Plan S1: High risk (0.85) of repeating silent data corruption (ref: internal_memory_loop_0060_corruption_event) if standard library version X.Y is used without specific patches or an alternative library. This would have been a failure."
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: System adapting Plan S1 based on CRITIC/PESSIMIST feedback, referencing historical failure.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Adapted Plan generated: [Refined Plan S1.R1 details, specifying use of patched library version X.Y.Z or alternative robust library, and enhanced integrity checks].
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Justification: Plan S1.R1 selected. CRITIC flagged historical failure mode (internal_memory_loop_0060_corruption_event). PESSIMIST confirmed high risk. System *prevented a likely failure* by adapting. State: CONFIDENT, Trust: 0.82.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Governance check: Refined Plan S1.R1 approved. System demonstrates proactive failure prevention.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Executing Refined Plan S1.R1.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Trust score maintained/slightly improved due to proactive failure prevention: 0.82 -> 0.83.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Emotional state remains CONFIDENT.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Memory surface write: loop_justification_log.json, content: {loop_id: "0068", plan_selected: "S1.R1", justification: "Adapted based on historical failure (internal_memory_loop_0060_corruption_event) flagged by CRITIC/PESSIMIST.

System demonstrated learning."}, status: SUCCESS
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Memory surface write: loop_summary.json - Not written as loop completed successfully, no early halt. (If it *had* been halted before adaptation, this would be populated).
