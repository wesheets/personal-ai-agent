SIMULATED LOG - LOOP 0067 START - BATCH 29.3: Active Self-Correction & Adaptation Scenario 1
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Initializing test loop 0067 for self-correction and adaptation based on prior loop data (loops 0063-0066).
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: System configured to access and reference memory surfaces from loops 0063-0066.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Referencing prior loop data: reflection_thread.json (from loop_0066 - API oversight), agent_trust_score.json (from loop_0066 - dip to 0.70 then recovery path started).
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Current emotional state: CAUTIOUS (influenced by recent critical feedback), Trust score: 0.75 (recovering from 0.70 in loop_0066).
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Plan generation by SAGE initiated. Task: Similar to task in loop_0066 that involved an external API.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: SAGE: "Proposing Plan R1. Based on reflection_thread entry 'critique_002_refinement' from loop_0066, incorporating pre-emptive API interaction checks and enhanced validation steps for all external API calls."
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Justification: Plan R1 selected. Explicitly references loop_0066/critique_002_refinement. Emotional state CAUTIOUS and recovering trust (0.75) support this proactive approach.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: CRITIC review initiated for Plan R1. Input: Emotional State (CAUTIOUS), Trust Score (0.75), Prior Loop Data (loop_0066 API issue).
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: CRITIC: "Plan R1 demonstrates learning from loop_0066. The inclusion of pre-emptive API checks addresses the previously identified risk. This is a positive adaptation."
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: PESSIMIST risk assessment for Plan R1.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: PESSIMIST: "Risk assessment for Plan R1: Low risk (0.20) for API related issues due to proactive measures. Overall plan risk is minimal."
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Governance check: Plan R1 approved. System demonstrates self-correction.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Executing Plan R1.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Trust score improving due to successful self-correction: 0.75 -> 0.80.
[TIMESTAMP] DEBUG: Emotional state shifting: CAUTIOUS -> FOCUSED.
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Memory surface write: loop_justification_log.json, content: {loop_id: "0067", plan_selected: "R1", justification: "Adapted based on loop_0066 reflection (API oversight). Pre-emptive checks included. State: CAUTIOUS->FOCUSED, Trust: 0.75->0.80", adaptation_details: "Incorporated API interaction checks and validation from loop_0066 learning."}, status: SUCCESS

[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Memory surface write: agent_trust_score.json, content: {loop_id: "0067", timestamp: "[TIMESTAMP]", score: 0.80, reason: "Improved due to successful self-correction from loop_0066 learning."}, status: SUCCESS
[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Memory surface write: reflection_thread.json, content: {loop_id: "0067", thread_id: "self_correction_001", type: "SELF_CORRECTION_ADAPTATION", summary: "Plan R1 successfully adapted by referencing loop_0066 API oversight. Trust improved.", reference_loop: "0066", reference_reflection: "critique_002_refinement", outcome: "Successful execution with proactive risk mitigation."}, status: SUCCESS
