# Batch 15.34 Validation Summary

**Objective:** Scaffold the `app/ui/components/SystemConsciousnessIndexViewer.jsx` component.

**Execution Steps & Outcomes:**

1.  **Workspace Continuity:** Operator instructions confirmed that a fresh repository clone was not required for this batch. Proceeded in the existing workspace.
2.  **Repository Structure Verification:** Confirmed the presence of the `/app/ui/components` directory and previously scaffolded components.
3.  **Truth Validation:**
    *   `validate_truth_surface.py` was not found.
    *   Fallback script `validate_file_tree_truth_v2.py` executed successfully (no syntax error correction needed this time as it was fixed in the previous batch).
    *   Result: `verified: true`, `safe_to_run: true`. Noted 1290 untracked files (expected `node_modules` and other build artifacts).
4.  **Component Scaffolding:**
    *   Created placeholder scaffold for `app/ui/components/SystemConsciousnessIndexViewer.jsx` with required header text and placeholder content.
5.  **Static Validation (ESLint):**
    *   Resolved frontend dependencies (`pnpm install` - already up to date).
    *   Checked/installed `@eslint/js` in frontend directory (already up to date).
    *   Ran ESLint on the new component (`SystemConsciousnessIndexViewer.jsx`) from the repository root.
    *   ESLint completed successfully with no errors or warnings.
6.  **Wiring Log:** Executed `log_wiring_to_manifest.py` for the scaffolded component.
7.  **Execution Plan Update:**
    *   Created `update_plan_15_34.py`.
    *   Corrected the known syntax error (line break after assignment) before execution.
    *   Executed script successfully, setting `verified: true` for Batch 15.34 in `batch_15_execution_plan.json`.

**Overall Status:** Completed successfully. Workspace continuity override was followed, and all validation, scaffolding, and update steps were executed without significant issues.
