Batch 15.31 Validation Summary (Restart)
---

Batch ID: 15.31
Component: app/main.py (wiring app/core/loop_controller.py)
Status: Verified (Zero-Drift Wiring)

Details:
- Environment reset and latest repo cloned.
- Truth validation (`validate_file_tree_truth_v2.py`) passed.
- Identified `app/main.py` as the correct integration point.
- Successfully added import statement: `from app.core.loop_controller import LoopController`.
- Successfully added placeholder instantiation: `controller = LoopController()`.
- Added commented-out placeholder invocation `# controller.start_loop()` for safety during zero-drift phase.
- Static validation (Python syntax check) passed for `app/main.py`.
- Wiring log successful: `log_wiring_to_manifest.py` executed after confirming `app/main.py` exists and is in the file tree plan.

Drift:
- None detected. Wiring performed strictly according to zero-drift constraints.
