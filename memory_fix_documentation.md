# Memory Module Fix and Route Map Generation

## Changes Made

### 1. Memory Module Implementation

I identified that the application was missing the `app.memory` module which was causing import errors in several files:
- `app/agents/orchestrator.py`
- `app/modules/orchestrator_logic.py`
- `app/routes/debug_routes.py`

All these files were trying to import `PROJECT_MEMORY` from `app.memory.project_memory`, but this module didn't exist.

To fix this issue, I:

1. Created the memory module directory structure:
   ```
   app/
     memory/
       __init__.py
       project_memory.py
   ```

2. Implemented the `project_memory.py` module with:
   - A global `PROJECT_MEMORY` dictionary to store project-related memory objects
   - Helper functions for initializing, getting, updating, and clearing project memory
   - Proper type hints and documentation

3. Verified the fix by:
   - Successfully importing `PROJECT_MEMORY` from `app.memory.project_memory`
   - Starting the application without import errors
   - Testing API endpoints that use the memory module

### 2. Route Map Generation

As requested, I created a comprehensive route map generator that:

1. Extracts all routes from the FastAPI application
2. Categorizes them by prefix or tags (core, loop, agent, persona, debug)
3. Generates three output files:
   - `route_map.json`: Structured JSON with route metadata
   - `route_map.md`: Human-readable markdown documentation
   - `route_map_persona_view.json`: Persona-specific capabilities

The generator successfully identified 33 total routes in the application.

## Testing Results

1. Memory Module Fix:
   - Successfully imported `PROJECT_MEMORY` from `app.memory.project_memory`
   - Application started without import errors
   - Tested `/health` endpoint: Returned `{"status":"ok"}`
   - Tested `/api/debug/memory/test-project` endpoint: Returned expected 404 response for non-existent project

2. Route Map Generation:
   - Successfully generated all three route map files
   - `route_map.json`: 21,891 bytes
   - `route_map.md`: 8,285 bytes
   - `route_map_persona_view.json`: 54,023 bytes

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push changes to the repository
2. Create a pull request with the changes
3. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for the memory module
4. Update documentation to reflect the new memory module structure
