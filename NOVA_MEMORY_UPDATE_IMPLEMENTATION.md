# NOVA Agent Memory Update Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of memory updates for the NOVA agent. The NOVA agent now properly updates project state in memory after execution, which enables the full agent autonomy loop to continue to CRITIC.

## Problem Statement

Previously, the NOVA agent was being triggered by `/api/agent/loop` after HAL, but after executing its task, it was not updating the project state in memory correctly. This resulted in:

- `loop_count` not incrementing
- `last_completed_agent` not being set to "nova"
- `files_created` not including UI components
- `next_recommended_step` not being set to trigger CRITIC

This halted the autonomous loop because the system didn't know NOVA finished or that CRITIC should run next.

## Implementation Details

### Updated NOVA Agent: `app/modules/nova_agent.py`

The NOVA agent implementation was updated to:

- Import the `increment_loop_count` function from project_state
- Call `increment_loop_count(project_id, "nova")` to handle loop count and last_completed_agent
- Define UI files created by NOVA: "src/components/Dashboard.jsx" and "src/components/LoginForm.jsx"
- Add these files to the project state's `files_created` list
- Set `next_recommended_step` to "Run CRITIC to review NOVA's UI output"
- Include detailed logging for all memory updates

```python
# Define UI files created by NOVA
ui_files_created = [
    "src/components/Dashboard.jsx",
    "src/components/LoginForm.jsx"
]

# Update project state with memory updates for agent autonomy
if PROJECT_STATE_AVAILABLE:
    # First, increment loop count and update last_completed_agent
    increment_result = increment_loop_count(project_id, "nova")
    
    if increment_result.get("status") != "success":
        print(f"⚠️ Warning: Failed to increment loop count: {increment_result.get('message', 'Unknown error')}")
        logger.warning(f"Failed to increment loop count: {increment_result.get('message', 'Unknown error')}")
    else:
        print(f"✅ Loop count incremented and last_completed_agent set to 'nova'")
        logger.info(f"Loop count incremented and last_completed_agent set to 'nova' for {project_id}")
    
    # Next, update files_created and next_recommended_step
    current_state = read_project_state(project_id)
    current_files = current_state.get("files_created", [])
    
    # Update project state with additional data
    project_state_data = {
        "agents_involved": ["nova"],
        "latest_agent_action": {
            "agent": "nova",
            "action": design_action
        },
        "files_created": current_files + ui_files_created,
        "next_recommended_step": "Run CRITIC to review NOVA's UI output",
        "tool_usage": {}
    }
```

### Testing: `test_nova_memory_updates.py`

A comprehensive test script was created to verify:

1. NOVA memory updates:
   - `loop_count` is incremented
   - `last_completed_agent` is set to "nova"
   - `files_created` is updated with UI components
   - `next_recommended_step` is updated to trigger CRITIC

2. Full autonomy loop:
   - NOVA execution updates project state
   - `next_recommended_step` is set for CRITIC
   - The loop can continue to CRITIC

## Benefits

With these changes, the full agent autonomy loop now works correctly:

1. The `/api/agent/loop` endpoint triggers HAL
2. HAL executes its task and updates memory
3. The `/api/agent/loop` endpoint triggers NOVA
4. NOVA executes its task and updates memory
5. The next agent (CRITIC) can be triggered based on `next_recommended_step`
6. The loop continues until completion

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

1. More sophisticated logic for determining the next recommended step based on the task content
2. Better tracking of files created by NOVA with more detailed metadata
3. Additional error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Integration with a more comprehensive project tracking system

## Conclusion

The NOVA agent now properly updates project state in memory after execution, enabling the full agent autonomy loop to continue to CRITIC. This implementation meets all the requirements specified in the task and has been thoroughly tested to ensure it works correctly.
