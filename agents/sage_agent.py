SAGE Meta-Summary Agent Module

This module provides the SAGE (System-wide Agent for Generating Explanations) agent
that reads memory logs and project state to generate narrative summaries of system activities.

The SAGE agent serves as a reflection engine that can summarize Promethios' recent actions,
memory logs, and project activity, enabling human-readable reports, system audits, and agent handoffs.
