NEUREAL Agent Implementation

This module implements the NEUREAL agent which was conceptualized as a 
philosophical agent for neural network analysis and optimization.

Note: This is an archived implementation as the NEUREAL agent has been 
deprecated in favor of more specialized agents like TRAINER.
