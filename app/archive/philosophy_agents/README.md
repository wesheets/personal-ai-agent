Philosophy Agents README

This directory contains archived implementations of philosophical agents that were
conceptualized but not fully implemented in the Promethios system. These agents
represent interesting conceptual directions that may be revisited in future
development cycles.

## Archived Agents

### CEO Agent
The CEO agent was conceptualized as a strategic coordinator for plan review and
agent resource allocation. Its primary responsibilities would have included:
- Reviewing strategic plans
- Reallocating agent resources
- Triggering system reorganization when needed

The CEO agent has been archived as a philosophical concept, but its schema
definitions remain in the main schema directory for potential future implementation.

### LIFETREE Agent
The LIFETREE agent was conceptualized as an environmental and sustainability
analysis agent. Its primary responsibilities would have included:
- Analyzing environmental impact of projects
- Providing sustainability recommendations
- Tracking ecological footprints
- Generating green alternatives

The LIFETREE agent has been fully archived as its functionality was deemed
outside the current scope of the Promethios system.

### NEUREAL Agent
The NEUREAL agent was conceptualized as a neural network analysis and optimization
agent. Its primary responsibilities would have included:
- Analyzing neural network architectures
- Optimizing model hyperparameters
- Detecting neural network bottlenecks
- Recommending architecture improvements

The NEUREAL agent has been fully archived as its functionality has been largely
superseded by the TRAINER agent.

## Relationship to Active Agents

Some of the concepts explored in these philosophical agents have been incorporated
into active agents in the system:
- CEO concepts → ORCHESTRATOR agent
- LIFETREE concepts → No direct replacement
- NEUREAL concepts → TRAINER agent

## Future Considerations

These archived agents may be revisited in future development cycles if their
specialized functionality becomes relevant to the system's evolving requirements.
The schema definitions and conceptual implementations provide a foundation for
potential future development.

## Usage Notes

These archived agents are not functional and should not be used in production.
Any attempt to use them will result in error responses indicating their archived
status. Developers interested in similar functionality should refer to the active
agents mentioned above.
