"""
Retry Hooks Integration for Agent Runner Functions

This file updates the agent_runner.py file to use the get_retry_status function
from the utils.retry_hooks module. This ensures agents can safely check and
respond to retry state logic during execution.

The changes include:
1. Adding import for retry_hooks module
2. Using get_retry_status in agent runner functions
3. Adding retry status logging
