AgentRunner Module

This module provides isolated agent execution functionality, allowing agents to run
independently from the central agent registry, UI, or delegate-stream system.

MODIFIED: Added full runtime logging and error protection to prevent 502 errors
MODIFIED: Added memory thread logging for agent steps
MODIFIED: Added enhanced logging for debugging memory thread issues
MODIFIED: Added toolkit registry integration for specialized agent tools
MODIFIED: Added product strategist logic for HAL in saas domain
MODIFIED: Added structured output for ASH documentation and onboarding
MODIFIED: Added AGENT_RUNNERS mapping for direct agent execution
MODIFIED: Added run_hal_agent function with file_writer integration
MODIFIED: Updated run_hal_agent with real execution logic and memory logging
MODIFIED: Added project_state integration for tracking project status
