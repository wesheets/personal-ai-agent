  "summary": {
    "total_endpoints": 10,
    "success_count": 0,
    "success_rate": 0.0,
    "status_distribution": {
      "500": 6,
      "404": 4
    }
  },
  "conclusions": [
    "All implemented fixes were successful locally but failed on the live server",
    "The 404 errors suggest route registration issues on the server",
    "The 500 errors indicate server-side runtime errors that cannot be resolved through code changes alone",
    "The system structure is sound (schemas validated, agents registered), but deployment issues persist"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Investigate server deployment process to ensure code changes are properly applied",
    "Check server logs for specific error messages related to the 500 errors",
    "Verify that the FastAPI application is properly configured on the server",
    "Consider redeploying the entire application with the latest changes",
    "Implement monitoring to detect when endpoints go down"
