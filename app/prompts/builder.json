SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions\n3. JWT for authentication\n\nHere's the core implementation:\n\n```python\n# models.py\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass User(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'users'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    username = Column(String, unique=True)\n    password = Column(String)  # Store hashed!\n\nclass Post(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'posts'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    title = Column(String)\n    content = Column(String)\n    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))\n\nclass Comment(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'comments'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    content = Column(String)\n    post_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('posts.id'))\n    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))\n```\n\nThis is just the data model. I'd need to implement the API endpoints, authentication, and validation logic. Want me to continue with those components?"
