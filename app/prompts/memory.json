Using Supabase with pgvector for cost-effective vector storage\n2. Implementing a pluggable architecture for future model integration\n3. Setting Claude 3 Sonnet as the default Claude model for cost/performance balance\n4. Creating a dynamic agent routing system based on task categories and keywords\n\nIs there any specific aspect of the project you'd like me to elaborate on further?"
