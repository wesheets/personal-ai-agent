Post-Merge Validation System Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for the Post-Merge Surface Validation system
for Promethios Phase 2.2.

1. OVERVIEW
-----------
The Post-Merge Surface Validation system validates cognitive surfaces after code merges
to ensure system integrity. It builds upon the existing Startup Surface Validation system
but is specifically designed to be triggered after merge operations.

2. COMPONENTS
------------
2.1 Core Validator Module
    - postmerge_validator.py: Main entry point for post-merge validation

2.2 Reused Components (from Startup Validation)
    - Validators: Reuse existing validators for all surface types
    - Health Scoring: Reuse existing weighted scoring system (30/30/20/10/10)
    - Drift Reporting: Adapt existing reporting mechanism for post-merge context
    - Memory Tagging: Adapt existing tagging system for post-merge context

2.3 New Components
    - merge_hook.sh: Shell script for manual triggering after merges
    - postmerge_validation.yml: GitHub Action for automatic triggering

3. ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM
----------------------
[Post-Merge Validation System]
    |
    |-- [Core Validator]
    |   |-- postmerge_validator.py
    |
    |-- [Reused Components]
    |   |-- Validators (agents, modules, schemas, endpoints, components)
    |   |-- Health Scorer
    |   |-- Drift Reporter
    |   |-- Memory Tagger
    |
    |-- [Trigger Mechanisms]
        |-- merge_hook.sh (Local)
        |-- postmerge_validation.yml (GitHub Action)

4. WORKFLOW
----------
4.1 Trigger Mechanisms
    - Local: Developer runs merge_hook.sh after manual merge
    - CI/CD: GitHub Action automatically runs after PR merge to main

4.2 Validation Process
    1. Load cognitive surfaces (ACI and PICE)
    2. Validate all surface types
    3. Calculate health scores
    4. Generate drift report
    5. Create memory tag
    6. Update system status and manifest
    7. Notify operator if drift detected

5. IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
-------------------------
5.1 Create postmerge_validator.py
    - Adapt validate.py from startup validation
    - Modify paths, tags, and reporting for post-merge context
    - Ensure same validation logic and health scoring

5.2 Create Trigger Mechanisms
    - Shell script for local installations
    - GitHub Action for CI/CD integration

5.3 Integration Points
    - System status updates
    - System manifest updates
    - Memory tagging
    - Operator notification

6. CONSTRAINTS
-------------
- No automatic repairs
- Full transparency in reporting
- Operator governance maintained
- No system surface mutations

7. DELIVERABLES
--------------
- postmerge_validator.py
- merge_hook.sh
- .github/workflows/postmerge_validation.yml
- Installation logs
- Documentation
