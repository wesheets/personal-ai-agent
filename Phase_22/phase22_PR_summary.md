# Phase 22 Pull Request (PR) Summary

**Date:** 2025-05-06

## 1. Overview of Phase 22

Phase 22 focused on introducing foundational mechanisms for agent archetyping, complexity budgeting, and structured schema change management. This phase aimed to enhance the system's self-awareness, resource management capabilities, and provide a controlled process for evolving its own schemas.

Key achievements across Phase 22 (Batches 22.0 - 22.3) include:

*   **Agent Archetype Definition:** Established a set of loop archetypes (e.g., Explore, Optimize, Implement) to categorize agent intentions.
*   **Complexity Budgeting:** Introduced a complexity budget system, allowing the system to track and potentially gate operations based on predefined cognitive costs associated with archetypes or domains.
*   **Archetype Classification:** Implemented a validator to classify loop intents into the defined archetypes.
*   **Loop Summary Enhancements:** Improved the loop summary process, including logging archetypes and introducing logic for summary rejection based on validation criteria (simulated Critic agent interaction).
*   **Agent Registration Drift Logging:** Implemented robust logging for instances where agents fail to load due to registration issues.
*   **Schema Change Proposal Mechanism:** Created schemas and memory surfaces for agents or operators to propose changes to existing system schemas.
*   **Operator Review Workflow for Schema Changes:** Integrated a simulated operator review process into the loop controller for approving or rejecting schema change proposals.
*   **Simulated Schema Change Application:** Developed a validator to simulate the application of approved schema changes.

## 2. Key Batches and Deliverables

### Batch 22.0: Define Archetypes & Introduce Complexity Budget
*   Defined loop archetypes and classification criteria.
*   Created `app/schemas/complexity_budget.schema.json` and initialized `app/memory/complexity_budget.json`.
*   Relevant documentation: `phase22_schema_surface_identification.md`.

### Batch 22.1: Implement Archetype Classifier & Activate Complexity Budgeting Influence
*   Implemented `app/validators/archetype_classifier.py`.
*   Enhanced `app/controllers/loop_controller.py` to use the classifier and log archetypes.
*   Updated `app/schemas/loop_summary.schema.json` and `app/memory/loop_summary.json`.
*   Integrated complexity budget tracking and influence logic into the loop controller.
*   Test loops: `0030a`, `0030b`.

### Batch 22.2: Implement Loop Summary Rejection and Register Drift Logging
*   Further enhanced `app/controllers/loop_controller.py` for loop summary evaluation and rejection (simulated Critic).
*   Created `app/memory/loop_summary_rejection_log.json`.
*   Implemented agent registration drift logging to `/home/ubuntu/drift_violation_log.json`.
*   Test loops: `0031a`, `0031b`, `0031c`.

### Batch 22.3: Implement Schema Change Management & Operator Review Workflow
*   Created `app/schemas/schema_change_request.schema.json` and initialized `app/memory/schema_change_request.json`.
*   Implemented `app/validators/schema_updater.py` for simulated schema change application.
*   Modified `app/controllers/loop_controller.py` to handle schema change proposals, simulate operator review, and call the schema updater.
*   Updated `app/core/agent_registry.py` with necessary imports.
*   Test loops: `0032a`, `0032b`.
*   Simulated operator inputs: `operator_input/review_decision_loop_0032a_schema_change_proposal_0032a_test.json`, `operator_input/review_decision_loop_0032b_schema_change_proposal_0032b_test.json`.
