# Phase 22 Progress Summary (Batch 22.0)

This document summarizes the progress made in Phase 22, specifically for Batch 22.0: "Define Archetypes & Introduce Complexity Budget".

## Batch 22.0: Define Archetypes & Introduce Complexity Budget

**Objective:** Define loop archetypes and initialize the complexity budget surface.

**Actions Taken & Outcomes:**

1.  **Repository Setup:**
    *   Successfully removed the old `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent-phase21` directory.
    *   Successfully removed any pre-existing `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent` directory.
    *   Cloned a fresh copy of the repository from `https://github.com/wesheets/personal-ai-agent.git` into `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent`.
    *   Verified the directory structure of the newly cloned repository.

2.  **Execution Plan Analysis:**
    *   Located the Phase 22 execution plan: `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/batches/batch_22_execution_plan.locked (2).json`.
    *   Read and analyzed the execution plan, saving its content to `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/phase22_execution_plan_content.json` for reference.
    *   Extracted objectives and requirements into `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/phase22_objectives.md`.
    *   Created a detailed TODO list for Phase 22: `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/todo_phase22.md`.

3.  **Dependency Check (Batch 22.0):**
    *   Checked dependencies: Batch 16.1 and Batch 21.1.
    *   Both were found to be marked `"verified": false` in their respective execution plan files.
    *   Received user authorization to bypass this dependency check and treat them as implicitly verified.
    *   Updated `todo_phase22.md` to reflect this bypass.

4.  **Define Archetypes (Batch 22.0):**
    *   Defined several loop archetypes: Explore, Optimize, Refactor, Implement, Validate/Verify, Debug/Remediate.
    *   Defined classification criteria for each archetype.
    *   Documented these definitions in `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/phase22_schema_surface_identification.md`.
    *   Updated `todo_phase22.md` to mark this as complete.

5.  **Build Complexity Budget Surface (Batch 22.0):**
    *   Created the schema file: `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/schemas/complexity_budget.schema.json`.
    *   Created and initialized the memory surface file: `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/memory/complexity_budget.json` with initial budget allocations for global, per-archetype, and per-domain categories.
    *   Updated `todo_phase22.md` to mark this as complete.

6.  **Functional Validation (Batch 22.0):**
    *   Verified that archetype definitions were documented as per the plan.
    *   Verified that the complexity budget surface and schema were created and initialized correctly, conforming to the requirements.
    *   Updated `todo_phase22.md` to mark validation as complete.

7.  **Log Wiring & Metadata (Batch 22.0):**
    *   Created and executed a Python script (`/home/ubuntu/update_metadata_phase22_batch0.py`) to update metadata files according to the CRITICAL FILE HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS:
        *   `/home/ubuntu/wiring_manifest.updated_phase22_36.json`: Ensured file exists (no new loop entries for this batch as it was definition-focused).
        *   `/home/ubuntu/file_tree.updated_post_phase36.json`: Added/updated entries for all files created or modified in Batch 22.0.
        *   `/home/ubuntu/promethios_file_tree_plan.v3.1.5_runtime_synced.json`: Added/updated entries for all files from Batch 22.0.
    *   All file updates were performed by loading the full prior version, merging changes schema-conformantly, and saving the entire complete file.

**Key Files Created/Modified in Batch 22.0:**

*   `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/phase22_execution_plan_content.json`
*   `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/phase22_objectives.md`
*   `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/todo_phase22.md` (created and updated)
*   `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/phase22_schema_surface_identification.md`
*   `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/schemas/complexity_budget.schema.json`
*   `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/memory/complexity_budget.json`
*   `/home/ubuntu/update_metadata_phase22_batch0.py` (script for metadata updates)
*   `/home/ubuntu/wiring_manifest.updated_phase22_36.json` (ensured existence/updated)
*   `/home/ubuntu/file_tree.updated_post_phase36.json` (updated)
*   `/home/ubuntu/promethios_file_tree_plan.v3.1.5_runtime_synced.json` (updated)

**Next Steps:** Proceed with Batch 22.1: "Implement Archetype Classifier & Activate Complexity Budgeting Influence".
