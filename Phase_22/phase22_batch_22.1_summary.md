# Phase 22, Batch 22.1: Implement Archetype Classifier & Activate Complexity Budgeting Influence - Summary

**Date:** 2025-05-06

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of Batch 22.1 was to implement an archetype classifier for categorizing loop intents and to activate the influence of the complexity budgeting system on loop execution. This involved creating the classifier, integrating it into the main loop controller, ensuring archetypes are logged, tracking complexity spending against budgets, and implementing mechanisms to gate or influence execution based on available budget.

## 2. Key Implementations

Several key components were developed or modified during this batch:

*   **Archetype Classifier (`app/validators/archetype_classifier.py`):**
    *   A new Python class `ArchetypeClassifier` was created.
    *   It defines archetypes (Explore, Optimize, Refactor, Implement, Validate_Verify, Debug_Remediate, Unknown) and uses keywords and description patterns to classify a given loop intent.
    *   The implementation includes basic test cases within the script.

*   **Loop Summary Schema (`app/schemas/loop_summary.schema.json`):**
    *   A new JSON schema was created to define the structure of entries in `app/memory/loop_summary.json`.
    *   Crucially, this schema includes a new `archetype` field to store the classified archetype for each loop, alongside other details like timestamps, status, and intent description.

*   **Loop Controller (`app/controllers/loop_controller.py`) Modifications:**
    *   **Archetype Classification Integration:** The `ArchetypeClassifier` is now instantiated and its `classify_intent` method is called at the beginning of each loop execution in the `main` function. The determined `loop_archetype` is logged.
    *   **Archetype Logging:** The `log_loop_summary` function was updated to accept and record the `archetype`, `timestamp_start`, `summary_of_actions`, `key_artifacts_produced`, and `errors_encountered` according to the new schema.
    *   **Complexity Budget Tracking:** 
        *   The controller now calculates an `accumulated_complexity_cost` throughout the loop, primarily based on agent execution costs (from `agent_cognitive_budget.json`) and error penalties.
        *   The `update_complexity_spending` function was implemented to update `app/memory/complexity_budget.json`. It deducts costs from global, per-archetype, and per-domain budgets. It also initializes entries if an archetype or domain is encountered for the first time.
        *   A `DEFAULT_LOOP_BASE_COST` is applied if a loop is successful but incurs no direct agent costs.
    *   **Complexity Budget Influence (Gating & Escalation):**
        *   The `check_complexity_budget_for_loop` function was implemented. This function is called before major processing in a loop. It checks the `estimated_complexity_cost` (provided in the loop intent or defaulted) against the remaining budget for the classified archetype, its associated domain, and the global budget.
        *   If the estimated cost exceeds available budget, the function returns `False`, and the `loop_controller` initiates an operator review process (`perform_operator_review` with `review_type="budget_override"`).
        *   If the operator approves the override, the loop proceeds. If rejected or timed out, the loop is terminated with a "rejected" status, and the reason is logged.
        *   The `estimated_loop_cost` was added to the loop intent structure to facilitate this pre-check.

## 3. Integration Tests (Loops 0030a & 0030b)

Two specific loop intents were created for testing:

*   **`app/memory/loop_intent_loop_0030a.json`:** Designed for a standard "Implement" task with an `estimated_complexity_cost` of 10, expected to be well within budget.
*   **`app/memory/loop_intent_loop_0030b.json`:** Designed for a complex "Implement" task with a high `estimated_complexity_cost` of 350. This was intended to test the budget gating/escalation, though the initial budget in `complexity_budget.json` was high enough that it passed the initial check.

Execution logs were generated:
*   `/home/ubuntu/logs/loop_0030a_execution.log`
*   `/home/ubuntu/logs/loop_0030b_execution.log`

## 4. Validation Results & Issues

*   **Archetype Classification:** The `loop_summary.json` and execution logs confirm that both `loop_0030a` and `loop_0030b` were correctly classified with the archetype "Implement".
*   **Budget Check Logic:** The `check_complexity_budget_for_loop` function was invoked for both loops. 
    *   For `loop_0030a` (cost 10), the log shows: "Budget Check Passed: Sufficient budget available."
    *   For `loop_0030b` (cost 350), the log also shows: "Budget Check Passed: Sufficient budget available." This was because the initial `complexity_budget.json` had substantial allocated amounts (e.g., Implement archetype: 3000, coding domain: 4000). While the *check* worked, the scenario for *insufficient budget gating before operator review* was not hit due to the high initial budget. The operator review for budget override was therefore not triggered during these specific test runs.
*   **Complexity Spending:** 
    *   `app/memory/complexity_budget.json` was updated after each loop. Since the Orchestrator agent (and subsequent agents) were not found, no agent-specific costs were incurred. Instead, the `DEFAULT_LOOP_BASE_COST` (1.0) was applied to the "Implement" archetype and its corresponding "coding" domain for both loops as they were marked as "failure" due to the missing agent rather than budget rejection.
*   **Issue Encountered - Agent Not Found:** A significant issue observed in both `loop_0030a_execution.log` and `loop_0030b_execution.log` was `ERROR:app.core.agent_registry:Agent with key 'Orchestrator' not found in registry.` This prevented the planned agent sequence from executing, leading to both loops concluding with a "failure" status. This issue masked the full extent of budget consumption and influence on a multi-agent sequence.
    *   The root cause appears to be related to errors during the agent auto-import process, with multiple agents (including `orchestrator_agent`) failing to load due to `unexpected indent (task_supervisor.py, line 405)` or other import errors as seen at the beginning of the execution logs.

## 5. Metadata Updates

To ensure traceability and auditability, the following metadata files were updated or created:

*   **`/home/ubuntu/wiring_manifest.updated_phase22_batch22_1.json`:** Created to log the inputs, outputs, and context for the development and execution of loops `0030a` and `0030b`, and the creation/modification of batch-specific files.
*   **`/home/ubuntu/file_tree.updated_batch22_1.json`:** Created to record details of all files created or modified during this batch.
*   The Promethios plan (`promethios_file_tree_plan.v3.1.5_runtime_synced.json`) will require a subsequent update to incorporate these new files and reflect the current state of the project structure.

## 6. Conclusion & Next Steps

Batch 22.1 successfully implemented the core logic for archetype classification and complexity budget influence, including gating mechanisms. The integration tests demonstrated the classification and budget checking. However, the critical issue of agents (specifically Orchestrator) failing to load prevented a full end-to-end validation of budget consumption across an agent sequence and the more nuanced budget influence behaviors (like biasing agent selection).

**Immediate next steps should include:**
1.  Diagnosing and fixing the agent loading errors (e.g., the `unexpected indent` in `task_supervisor.py` and other import issues).
2.  Rerunning integration tests (potentially with adjusted initial budget values in `complexity_budget.json` to better test gating scenarios) once agents are loading correctly.
3.  Updating the Promethios plan to reflect all file changes from this batch.
