# Phase 22, Batch 22.2: Implement Loop Summary Rejection and Register Drift Logging - Summary

**Batch ID:** 22.2
**Date Completed:** 2025-05-06

## 1. Batch Objectives

The primary objectives for Batch 22.2 were to:
1.  Enhance the loop summary processing pipeline to include validation based on archetype consistency, cognitive cost, trust scores, and belief conflict logs.
2.  Implement logic to invoke the `CriticAgent` (or internal fallback) to evaluate generated loop summaries.
3.  Update `app/memory/loop_summary.json` entries with a `summary_status` field (e.g., "accepted", "rejected", "pending_review").
4.  Create and populate `app/memory/loop_summary_rejection_log.json` when a summary is rejected, detailing the reason and validator.
5.  Implement robust agent registration drift logging to `/home/ubuntu/drift_violation_log.json` when attempts to load an agent fail, without auto-patching.
6.  Create and execute test loops (0031a, 0031b, 0031c) to validate these new functionalities.

## 2. Implementation Details

Key modifications and additions were made to the system:

*   **`app/controllers/loop_controller.py` Enhancements:**
    *   A new function `evaluate_loop_summary` was introduced to orchestrate summary validation. This function gathers data (simulated trust scores, belief conflicts, cognitive cost) and attempts to invoke the `CriticAgent`.
    *   If the `CriticAgent` is not found, an agent registration drift is logged to `/home/ubuntu/drift_violation_log.json`.
    *   The actual summary evaluation logic by the `CriticAgent` was simulated within `evaluate_loop_summary` for this batch, focusing on the integration points. Rules were based on simulated trust score, cognitive cost for archetype, and presence of belief conflicts.
    *   The `log_loop_summary` function was updated to include the `summary_status` field.
    *   Calls to `get_agent` were wrapped in try-except blocks to catch `AgentNotFoundException` and log drift using the new `log_agent_registration_drift` function.
    *   The main loop execution logic now calls `evaluate_loop_summary` before finalizing the loop summary log entry.
*   **New Log Surfaces:**
    *   `app/memory/loop_summary_rejection_log.json`: Created to store details of rejected loop summaries, including `loop_id`, `timestamp`, `rejection_reason`, and `validator_agent_id`.
    *   `/home/ubuntu/drift_violation_log.json`: This existing file was appended to with new drift logs if agents (like `Critic` or the test agent `historian`) were not found during execution.
*   **Schema Update:**
    *   `app/schemas/loop_summary.schema.json`: Updated to include the new `summary_status` field with enum values ("accepted", "rejected", "pending_review") and made it a required field.
*   **Drift Logging Function:**
    *   A new function `log_agent_registration_drift` was added to `loop_controller.py` to standardize the logging of agent registration failures to `/home/ubuntu/drift_violation_log.json`.

## 3. Test Loops and Validation

Three specific test loops were created and executed:

*   **`app/memory/loop_intent_loop_0031a.json`:**
    *   **Design:** Valid summary expected to be accepted; standard operation, low complexity.
    *   **Execution Log:** `/home/ubuntu/logs/loop_0031a_execution.log`
    *   **Outcome:** The `loop_summary.json` entry for `0031a` shows `"summary_status": "accepted"`. The Orchestrator agent was not found (known issue), and this drift was logged.
*   **`app/memory/loop_intent_loop_0031b.json`:**
    *   **Design:** Summary expected to be rejected due to high cognitive cost or low trust (simulated by intent parameters).
    *   **Execution Log:** `/home/ubuntu/logs/loop_0031b_execution.log`
    *   **Outcome:** The `loop_summary.json` entry for `0031b` shows `"summary_status": "rejected"`. An entry was successfully added to `app/memory/loop_summary_rejection_log.json` detailing the rejection. The Orchestrator agent was not found (known issue), and this drift was logged.
*   **`app/memory/loop_intent_loop_0031c.json`:**
    *   **Design:** Attempt to call a deliberately unregistered agent (`historian`) to trigger agent registration drift logging.
    *   **Execution Log:** `/home/ubuntu/logs/loop_0031c_execution.log`
    *   **Outcome:** An agent registration drift entry for the `historian` agent was successfully logged in `/home/ubuntu/drift_violation_log.json`. The `loop_summary.json` entry for `0031c` shows `"summary_status": "accepted"` (as the failure was agent loading, not summary content itself, and the simulated Critic accepted it). The Orchestrator agent was also not found, and this drift was logged.

**Validation Summary:**
*   The `summary_status` field was correctly populated in `app/memory/loop_summary.json` for all test loops.
*   `app/memory/loop_summary_rejection_log.json` was correctly populated for loop `0031b`.
*   `/home/ubuntu/drift_violation_log.json` correctly logged drifts for the `Orchestrator` (in all test loops due to the pre-existing issue) and for the `historian` agent in loop `0031c`.

    *   `/home/ubuntu/promethios_file_tree_plan.v3.1.6_runtime_synced.json` (New)

## 5. Issues and Observations

*   **Promethios Plan File Issue:** During the execution of `update_promethios_file_tree_plan_batch22_2.py`, the previous plan file (`/home/ubuntu/promethios_file_tree_plan.v3.1.5_runtime_synced.json`) was reported as empty or having an invalid JSON structure ("Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)"). The script was remediated to handle this by initializing with a default structure, allowing the update to proceed. This suggests a potential issue with how the v3.1.5 plan was saved or if it was indeed empty.
*   **Orchestrator Agent Drift:** The `Orchestrator` agent continued to be reported as not found (due to an import error identified in Batch 22.1) during the execution of test loops 0031a, 0031b, and 0031c. This drift was correctly logged to `/home/ubuntu/drift_violation_log.json` as per the new drift logging mechanism.
*   **Simulated Critic Logic:** The summary evaluation logic within `loop_controller.py` that simulates the `CriticAgent`'s decision was based on predefined rules for this batch. A more sophisticated `CriticAgent` with its own input schema for summaries (`CriticSummaryEvaluationInput`) and detailed evaluation criteria would be required for production-level summary validation.

This batch successfully implemented the core mechanisms for loop summary rejection and agent registration drift logging, providing a more robust and auditable loop execution framework.
