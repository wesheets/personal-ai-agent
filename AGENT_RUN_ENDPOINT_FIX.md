# Fix for /api/agent/run Endpoint (404 Error)

## Issue Description
The `/api/agent/run` endpoint was returning a 404 error, preventing the agent cognition chain from functioning properly. This was the final blocker for enabling the Playground ‚Üí Live Cognition Chain.

## Root Cause Analysis
After examining the codebase, I identified the root cause of the issue:

1. In `routes/agent_routes.py`, the endpoint was correctly defined as a POST endpoint at `/run`
2. In `app/main.py`, the router was correctly registered with the prefix `/api/agent`
3. However, in `app/modules/agent_runner.py`, the `AGENT_RUNNERS` dictionary was **not defined**
4. This dictionary is imported in `agent_routes.py` and is critical for mapping agent IDs to their runner functions

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Added AGENT_RUNNERS Dictionary to agent_runner.py
Added the missing `AGENT_RUNNERS` dictionary at the end of the file:

```python
# Define AGENT_RUNNERS dictionary to map agent_id to runner functions
# This is the critical fix for the /api/agent/run endpoint
print("üîÑ Defining AGENT_RUNNERS dictionary for /api/agent/run endpoint")
AGENT_RUNNERS = {
    "hal": run_hal_agent,
    "nova": run_nova_agent,
    "sage": run_sage_agent,
    "ash": run_ash_agent,
    "critic": run_critic_agent
}
print(f"‚úÖ AGENT_RUNNERS defined with {len(AGENT_RUNNERS)} agents: {list(AGENT_RUNNERS.keys())}")
```

### 2. Enhanced Debug Logging in agent_routes.py
Added debug logging to verify the router is loaded and the AGENT_RUNNERS dictionary is properly populated:

```python
# Debug print to verify this file is loaded
print("‚úÖ AGENT ROUTES LOADED")
print(f"‚úÖ Available agents in AGENT_RUNNERS: {list(AGENT_RUNNERS.keys())}")
```

Also added more detailed logging in the `/run` endpoint:

```python
print(f"üîç Available agents: {list(AGENT_RUNNERS.keys())}")
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
With these changes, the `/api/agent/run` endpoint should now:

1. Be properly registered and accessible at `/api/agent/run`
2. Successfully map agent IDs to their corresponding runner functions
3. Return a 200 OK response when triggered with valid parameters
4. Execute the HAL agent when requested

## Testing Instructions
To test the endpoint, send a POST request to `/api/agent/run` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "hal",
  "project_id": "demo_001",
  "task": "Continue cognitive build loop"
}
```

## Validation Sequence
Once the fix is deployed, the following sequence should work:

1. POST `/api/project/start`
2. GET `/api/system/status?project_id=demo_001`
3. POST `/api/agent/run`
4. POST `/api/system/summary`

This will enable the complete Playground ‚Üí Live Cognition Chain.

## Deployment Notes
These changes should be pushed directly to the main branch to trigger a production deployment. The debug logging will help verify that the fix is working correctly in the production environment.
