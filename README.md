# Task Memory Loop + Multi-Agent State Tracking

## Overview
This system implements a persistent memory-driven state management system that allows the Planner Agent to track subtask status, recall task states across sessions, resume long-running goals, avoid repeating completed work, and enable agents to update task status and outcomes.

## Components

### 1. Task State Manager (`/app/core/task_state_manager.py`)
The Task State Manager implements a task tracking model that stores:
- Goal and subtask IDs
- Subtask descriptions
- Agent assignments
- Status information (queued, in_progress, complete, failed)
- Timestamps and updates
- Output summaries and error messages

This component provides CRUD operations for task states, memory integration, and logging support.

### 2. Status Tracker Tool (`/app/tools/status_tracker.py`)
The Status Tracker Tool allows agents to update task status with operations like:
- Marking tasks as complete
- Reporting failures
- Indicating blocked status
- Reporting progress
- Requesting retries

### 3. Planner Orchestrator (`/app/core/planner_orchestrator.py`)
The Planner Orchestrator has been enhanced to:
- Check task memory before assigning work
- Update status on assignment, completion, or failure
- Retry failed tasks when confidence is above threshold
- Log updates to task state logs
- Allow continuation of partially complete goals

### 4. Planner Agent Enhancer (`/app/core/planner_agent_enhancer.py`)
The Planner Agent Enhancer provides:
- Task prioritization based on memory
- Escalation for stalled or failed tasks
- Queryable goal progress
- Persistence across sessions

### 5. Planner Agent Configuration (`/app/prompts/planner.json`)
The Planner Agent configuration has been updated to support:
- Task prioritization factors
- Escalation policies
- Goal tracking settings
- Agent assignment rules

## Usage

### Creating a Task
```python
from app.core.task_state_manager import get_task_state_manager

task_manager = get_task_state_manager()
task_state = task_manager.create_task_state(
    goal_id="goal_123",
    subtask_id="goal_123_subtask_1",
    subtask_description="Implement feature X",
    assigned_agent="builder"
)
```

### Updating Task Status
```python
from app.tools.status_tracker import get_status_tracker

status_tracker = get_status_tracker()
result = status_tracker.complete_task(
    subtask_id="goal_123_subtask_1",
    output_summary="Feature X implemented successfully"
)
```

### Processing a Goal with Memory
```python
from app.core.planner_agent_enhancer import get_planner_agent_enhancer

enhancer = get_planner_agent_enhancer()
result = enhancer.process_goal_with_memory({
    "id": "goal_123",
    "description": "Implement new feature",
    "type": "development"
})
```

### Checking Goal Progress
```python
from app.core.task_state_manager import get_task_state_manager

task_manager = get_task_state_manager()
progress = task_manager.get_goal_progress("goal_123")
print(f"Completion: {progress['completion_percentage']}%")
```

## Testing
A comprehensive test suite is available in `test_task_memory_system.py` that validates:
- Task state management
- Status tracking
- Goal continuation
- Multi-agent coordination
- Persistence across sessions

Run the tests with:
```
python test_task_memory_system.py
```

## Integration with Existing System
This system integrates with the existing Planner Agent and enhances its capabilities with persistent memory-driven state management. It builds on the existing agent architecture and extends it with robust task tracking and coordination features.
