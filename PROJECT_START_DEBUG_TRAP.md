# Project Start Debug Trap Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to implement debug traps and error handling for the `/api/project/start` endpoint.

## Problem

The `/api/project/start` endpoint was returning a silent error with a misleading response:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Failed to start project: ",
  "error_details": ""
}
```

Despite the error, the endpoint was returning a 200 status code, which made debugging difficult.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added Debug Logging

Added detailed debug logging to track the execution flow:

```python
# Add debug logging for project start
print(f"üß™ Project start triggered: {project_id} {goal} {agent}")

# Log orchestrator function call
print(f"‚öôÔ∏è Calling orchestrator agent...")

# Log orchestrator result
print(f"‚úÖ Orchestrator result: {result}")
```

### 2. Implemented Agent Key Validation

Added validation to check if the requested agent exists in AGENT_RUNNERS:

```python
# Validate agent exists in AGENT_RUNNERS
if agent not in AGENT_RUNNERS:
    return {
        "status": "error",
        "message": f"Unknown agent: {agent}",
        "agent": agent,
        "goal": goal,
        "project_id": project_id
    }
```

### 3. Added Exception Handling for Agent Execution

Wrapped the agent execution in a try/except block with detailed error logging:

```python
try:
    # Run the specified agent
    result = run_agent(
        agent_id=agent,
        project_id=project_id,
        goal=goal,
        additional_context=request.get("additional_context", {})
    )
    
    # Log orchestrator result
    print(f"‚úÖ Orchestrator result: {result}")
    
    # Return success response
    # ...
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ùå Agent execution failed: {e}")
    return {
        "status": "error",
        "message": "Agent execution failed",
        "error_details": str(e),
        "project_id": project_id,
        "agent": agent,
        "goal": goal
    }
```

### 4. Ensured Consistent Response Format

Modified all response objects to include project_id, agent, and goal fields even in error cases:

```python
return {
    "status": "error",
    "message": "goal is required",
    "agent": agent or "unknown",
    "goal": "missing",
    "project_id": project_id
}
```

## Expected Outcomes

With these changes, the `/api/project/start` endpoint should now:

1. Provide detailed debug logs in the console for troubleshooting
2. Return proper error messages with specific details
3. Include consistent response fields (project_id, agent, goal) in all responses
4. Properly handle missing or invalid agents
5. Catch and report exceptions during agent execution

## Testing

The implementation has been tested locally and the server starts successfully. When deployed to production, we should see:

1. Console log traces showing:
   - ‚úÖ AGENT_RUNNERS load
   - ‚öôÔ∏è Orchestrator agent call
   - ‚úÖ Orchestrator result

2. Proper status codes:
   - 200 for successful execution
   - Appropriate error codes (422/500) for failures

3. Detailed error messages in the response payload when failures occur

## Next Steps

After deployment, we should test the endpoint with various scenarios:
- Valid request with existing agent
- Request with missing parameters
- Request with non-existent agent
- Request that triggers an exception during execution

This will verify that all error handling paths work correctly and provide useful debugging information.
