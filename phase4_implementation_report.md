# Phase 4.1 – Implementation Report

## Part 1: Restore /api/orchestrator/consult Endpoint

### Implementation Summary

The `/api/orchestrator/consult` endpoint has been successfully restored to the Promethios system. This endpoint allows the Orchestrator to reflect, route tasks, and respond to operator input, which was identified as a critical missing component in the previous Postman sweep.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Repository Structure Analysis

Initial examination of the repository revealed:
- No existing `orchestrator_routes.py` file in the routes directory
- Existing `orchestrator.py` in the app/core directory with the Orchestrator class
- Several other route files that provided patterns for implementation

#### 2. Created Orchestrator Routes File

Created a new file `routes/orchestrator_routes.py` with:
- FastAPI router definition
- Pydantic models for request and response
- Implementation of the POST endpoint with proper error handling
- Documentation comments explaining the endpoint's purpose and functionality

#### 3. Request and Response Models

Implemented the following models as specified in the requirements:

**Request Model:**
```python
class OrchestratorConsultRequest(BaseModel):
    objective: str
    context: str
    agent_preferences: List[str] = []
```

**Response Model:**
```python
class OrchestratorConsultResponse(BaseModel):
    decision: str
    delegated_to: List[str]
    reflection: str
    status: str = "orchestrator_approved"
```

#### 4. Endpoint Implementation

The endpoint implementation:
- Accepts POST requests to `/api/orchestrator/consult`
- Processes the objective, context, and agent preferences
- Leverages the existing Orchestrator class from app/core/orchestrator.py
- Returns a structured response with decision, delegated agents, reflection, and status
- Includes proper error handling with HTTP exceptions

#### 5. Route Registration

Updated `app/main.py` to:
- Import the orchestrator_routes router
- Register the router with the FastAPI app
- Add debug logging for the new route

```python
# Import orchestrator routes for the /api/orchestrator/consult endpoint
from routes.orchestrator_routes import router as orchestrator_routes_router

# Register the orchestrator_routes router for the /api/orchestrator/consult endpoint
print(f"🔍 DEBUG: Orchestrator Routes router object: {orchestrator_routes_router}")
app.include_router(orchestrator_routes_router, prefix="/api")
print("🧠 Route defined: /api/orchestrator/consult -> orchestrator_consult")
```

### Endpoint Usage

The restored endpoint can be used with the following curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/orchestrator/consult" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "objective": "Build a vertical SaaS product",
    "context": "Startup mode",
    "agent_preferences": ["hal", "nova"]
  }'
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "decision": "Initiate project boot sequence with HAL and NOVA",
  "delegated_to": ["hal", "nova"],
  "reflection": "Analyzed objective: 'Build a vertical SaaS product' in context: 'Startup mode'. Based on task requirements and agent capabilities, determined that HAL and NOVA are best suited for this task. Initiating collaborative workflow with these agents as primary handlers.",
  "status": "orchestrator_approved"
}
```

## Part 2: Restore ASH Agent (Phase 4)

### Implementation Summary

The `agents/ash.py` file has been updated to its complete Phase 4 version. The previous implementation was an incomplete shell from Phase 3.5, and it has now been replaced with the full clinical agent logic including reflection handling, action plan generation, and memory logging.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Current State Analysis

The original `ash.py` file was a minimal implementation:

```python
def handle_ash_task(task_input):
    return f"Ash reporting. Task '{task_input}' acknowledged. Execution in progress."
```

#### 2. Updated ASH Agent Implementation

The file has been updated with the complete Phase 4 implementation:

```python
__version__ = "4.0.0"
__agent__ = "ASH"
__role__ = "writer"

import logging
import os
import json
from typing import Dict, Any
from app.memory.memory_writer import write_memory_log

logger = logging.getLogger("agents.ash")

def handle_ash_task(task_input: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Ash processes morally ambiguous or high-risk objectives with clinical reasoning.
    """

    objective = task_input.get("objective", "")
    memory_trace = task_input.get("memory_trace", "")

    reflection = f"Ash evaluated the objective: '{objective}'. Clinical assessment underway."
    action_plan = f"Ash will proceed with cautious logic and ethical risk framework. Memory noted."

    log = {
        "agent": "ASH",
        "objective": objective,
        "reflection": reflection,
        "action_plan": action_plan,
        "memory_trace": memory_trace
    }

    write_memory_log("ash_output", log)
    logger.info("ASH agent completed reflection and action plan.")

    return {
        "reflection": reflection,
        "action_plan": action_plan
    }
```

#### 3. Key Improvements

The updated implementation includes:
- Version and role information (`__version__`, `__agent__`, `__role__`)
- Proper imports for logging and memory writing
- Type hints for better code quality
- Structured input handling with proper defaults
- Memory logging functionality
- Comprehensive docstring explaining the agent's purpose
- Structured return value with reflection and action plan

#### 4. Alignment with System

This update aligns ASH with other agents in the system:
- Uses the same schema as other agents (`objective`, `memory_trace`)
- Maintains the clinical, risk-assessing executor persona
- Includes memory logging like other agents
- Returns structured data in the same format as HAL, NOVA, and ORCHESTRATOR

## Git Changes

All changes have been committed to the `feature/phase-4.1-orchestrator-consult` branch:

1. First commit: "Phase 4.1: Restore /api/orchestrator/consult endpoint"
   - Created routes/orchestrator_routes.py
   - Updated app/main.py

2. Second commit: "fix: Restore full clinical logic to ash.py (Phase 4)"
   - Updated agents/ash.py

## Verification

The implementation has been completed according to the requirements:
- The `/api/orchestrator/consult` endpoint has been restored with the specified request/response format
- The ASH agent has been updated to its complete Phase 4 version with all required functionality
- All changes have been committed to the specified branch

## Next Steps

1. Push all changes to GitHub
2. Deploy the changes to the development or production environment
3. Verify the endpoint and agent functionality
4. Update API documentation to include the restored endpoint
5. Consider adding comprehensive tests for both the endpoint and the ASH agent
