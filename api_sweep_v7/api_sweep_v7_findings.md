# API Sweep V7 Findings and Issues

## Overview

This document details the findings and issues discovered during the Phase 5.3 Connected API Verification Sweep (V7). The test was conducted against the production API at `https://web-production-2639.up.railway.app` on April 17, 2025.

## Summary of Results

- **Total Endpoints Tested:** 20
- **Working Endpoints:** 17
- **Failed Endpoints:** 3
- **API Health Percentage:** 72.73% (8/11 expected working endpoints)

## Detailed Findings

### Working Endpoints (✅)

The following endpoints are functioning correctly as expected:

1. **GET /api/agent/list**
   - Returns a list of all agents
   - Status: 200 OK
   - Confirms all 5 agents are registered

2. **POST /api/agent/run**
   - Successfully tested with all agent types (HAL, NOVA, CRITIC, ASH)
   - Status: 200 OK
   - All agents execute their tasks correctly

3. **POST /api/agent/loop**
   - Looping functionality is working
   - Status: 200 OK

4. **POST /api/agent/delegate**
   - Delegation functionality is working
   - Status: 200 OK

5. **POST /api/memory/write**
   - Memory writing is functioning
   - Status: 200 OK

6. **GET /api/memory/read**
   - Memory reading is functioning
   - Status: 200 OK

7. **POST /api/memory/summarize**
   - Memory summarization is working
   - Status: 200 OK

8. **GET /api/debug/memory/log**
   - Debug memory logging is working
   - Status: 200 OK

### Failed Endpoints (❌)

The following endpoints are not functioning as expected:

1. **GET /api/memory/thread**
   - **Expected Status:** 200 OK
   - **Actual Status:** 404 Not Found
   - **Issue:** Endpoint is marked as working in requirements but returns 404
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Impact:** Thread-based memory by project functionality is unavailable

2. **GET /api/project/state**
   - **Expected Status:** 200 OK
   - **Actual Status:** 404 Not Found
   - **Issue:** Endpoint is marked as NEW in requirements but returns 404
   - **Severity:** High
   - **Impact:** Unable to retrieve JSON project state

3. **POST /api/orchestrator/consult**
   - **Expected Status:** 200 OK
   - **Actual Status:** 422 Unprocessable Entity
   - **Issue:** Endpoint is accessible but returns validation error
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Impact:** Orchestrator consultation functionality is broken

### Expected Non-Working Endpoints

The following endpoints were expected to fail and did fail as anticipated:

1. **POST /api/train** - 404 (Planned for Phase 6)
2. **POST /api/plan** - 404 (Missing or stubbed)
3. **POST /api/snapshot** - 404 (Not yet implemented)
4. **GET /api/status** - 404 (Legacy placeholder)
5. **GET /api/system/integrity** - 404 (Path mismatch)
6. **GET /api/debug/agents** - 404 (Double prefix or unregistered)

## Health Percentage Calculation Correction

The initial calculation reported 100% health, which was incorrect. The corrected calculation is:

- **Total expected working endpoints:** 11
- **Actually working endpoints:** 8
- **Failed endpoints that should be working:** 3
- **Corrected health percentage:** 72.73% (8/11)

This calculation only considers endpoints that were expected to work (marked with ✅ in the requirements) and does not include endpoints that were expected to fail (marked with ❌ in the requirements).

## Comparison with Previous API Sweep (v4.7)

Based on the test results, we can highlight the following improvements since API Sweep v4.7:

1. **HAL, NOVA, CRITIC, and ASH agents** are all confirmed working through the `/api/agent/run` endpoint
2. **Memory operations** (write, read, summarize) are functioning correctly
3. **Debug memory logging** is now working properly

## Lingering Issues

The following issues remain to be addressed:

1. **Memory Thread Functionality** - The `/api/memory/thread` endpoint is not implemented
2. **Project State Endpoint** - The new `/api/project/state` endpoint is not implemented
3. **Orchestrator Consultation** - The `/api/orchestrator/consult` endpoint has validation issues

These issues should be prioritized for the next development phase to achieve 100% API health.
