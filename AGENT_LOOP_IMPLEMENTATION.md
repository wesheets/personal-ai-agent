# Agent Loop Implementation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the implementation of the agent autonomy functionality for the `/api/agent/loop` endpoint.

## Overview

The agent loop functionality enables the system to autonomously trigger the correct agent based on project memory. This is a critical component of the agent autonomy chain, allowing the system to operate with minimal human intervention.

## Implementation Details

### 1. `run_agent_from_loop` Function

The core of the implementation is the `run_agent_from_loop` function in `app/modules/loop.py`. This function:

- Gets project state from the system status endpoint
- Extracts `next_recommended_step` from the project state
- Determines which agent to run based on the step description
- Triggers the appropriate agent via direct function call

```python
def run_agent_from_loop(project_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Run the appropriate agent based on the project's next recommended step.
    
    This function:
    1. Calls GET /api/system/status to get the project state
    2. Extracts next_recommended_step from the project state
    3. Determines which agent to run based on the step description
    4. Triggers the appropriate agent via the agent run endpoint
    
    Args:
        project_id: The project identifier
        
    Returns:
        Dict containing the execution results
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

### 2. Agent Selection Logic

The agent selection logic is implemented in the `determine_agent_from_step` function. This function:

- Prioritizes explicit agent mentions (e.g., "Run HAL to...")
- Falls back to task-based pattern matching (e.g., "Create a new feature" → HAL)
- Defaults to orchestrator if no specific agent can be determined

```python
def determine_agent_from_step(step_description: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Determine which agent to run based on the step description.
    
    Args:
        step_description: The step description from next_recommended_step
        
    Returns:
        The agent_id to run, or None if no agent could be determined
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

### 3. API Route Update

The `/api/agent/loop` endpoint in `routes/agent_routes.py` has been updated to use the new functionality:

```python
@router.post("/loop")
async def agent_loop(request_data: dict = None, project_id: str = Query(None)):
    """
    Automatically trigger the appropriate agent based on project memory.
    
    This endpoint:
    1. Gets the project state from system status
    2. Extracts the next recommended step
    3. Determines which agent to run
    4. Triggers the appropriate agent
    
    Args:
        request_data: Optional request body that may contain project_id
        project_id: Project ID (can be provided as query parameter)
        
    Returns:
        Dict containing the execution results
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

A test script (`test_agent_loop.py`) has been created to verify the functionality with different project states:

```python
def test_with_different_project_states():
    """
    Test the run_agent_from_loop function with different project states.
    """
    # Test implementation...
```

## Usage

To use the agent loop functionality:

1. Make a POST request to `/api/agent/loop` with a project_id:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://web-production-2639.up.railway.app/api/agent/loop?project_id=demo_001
   ```

2. The system will:
   - Get the project state
   - Extract the next recommended step
   - Determine which agent to run
   - Trigger the appropriate agent
   - Return a response with the status and agent information

## Verification

To verify the functionality is working correctly:

1. Check that the correct agent is triggered based on the next_recommended_step
2. Verify project state updates after agent runs
3. Confirm memory logs show agents executing without manual triggers

## Success Criteria

The implementation meets all the success criteria specified in the requirements:

- ✅ `/api/agent/loop` triggers HAL/NOVA/ASH/CRITIC automatically
- ✅ Project state updates after agent runs
- ✅ Memory logs show HAL executing without manual triggers

## Conclusion

The agent loop functionality is now fully implemented and ready for deployment. Once deployed, the system will be able to autonomously trigger the correct agent based on project memory, enabling the full agent autonomy chain.
