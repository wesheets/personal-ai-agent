# Agent Output Panel Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document details the implementation of the Agent Output Panel feature for the Ground Control UI in Playground. The panel displays files, summaries, and task outputs created by Promethios agents during cognition.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Frontend Component
Created a new React component `AgentOutputPanel.jsx` that displays:
- List of files created by agents
- Last completed agent and task
- Current status
- Summary information
- Optional file preview buttons

The component follows the same patterns as existing panels:
- Automatic polling every 10 seconds
- Loading states and error handling
- Consistent styling with existing panels

### 2. Backend API Endpoint
Implemented a new API endpoint in `project_routes.py`:
```python
@router.get("/output")
async def get_project_output(
    project_id: str = Query(..., description="The project identifier")
):
    # Implementation details...
```

The endpoint returns:
- Files created from project state
- Last agent and task from memory entries
- Summary from SAGE agent
- Current status

### 3. Integration
Integrated the new panel into `ControlRoom.jsx`:
- Added it alongside existing SystemStatusPanel and SystemSummaryPanel
- Updated the grid layout from 2 columns to 3 columns

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Component (AgentOutputPanel.jsx)
The component fetches data from the `/api/project/output` endpoint and displays it in a structured format. It includes:
- Loading state while data is being fetched
- Error handling for API failures
- Automatic polling to keep data updated
- Structured display of files, agent, task, and summary information
- Optional file preview buttons for each file

### Backend API Endpoint (project_routes.py)
The endpoint aggregates data from multiple sources:
1. Project state for files_created and status
2. Memory entries for last agent and task
3. SAGE agent for summary information

It handles errors gracefully and provides fallback values when data is unavailable.

### Integration (ControlRoom.jsx)
The component is integrated into the existing UI layout:
```jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <SystemStatusPanel projectId={data.project_id} />
  <SystemSummaryPanel projectId={data.project_id} />
  <AgentOutputPanel projectId={data.project_id} />
</div>
```

## Completion Criteria Verification

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Output panel appears in Playground | ✅ | Integrated into ControlRoom.jsx |
| Files created by agents are visible | ✅ | Displayed in a list with preview buttons |
| Task descriptions + summary are visible | ✅ | Shown in dedicated sections |
| UI updates automatically | ✅ | Polling every 10 seconds |
| Works for any project_id | ✅ | projectId is passed as a prop |

## Future Enhancements
Potential future enhancements could include:
1. Implementing actual file preview functionality
2. Adding file download capabilities
3. Expanding the panel to show more detailed agent output history
4. Adding filtering options for files by type or agent
