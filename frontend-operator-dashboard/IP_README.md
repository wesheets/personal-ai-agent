## üì¶ Included Components

The following IP is explicitly claimed:

- **Promethios SDK Contract v1.0.0**
- Modular task packet schema (`task_id`, `project_id`, `memory_trace_id`, etc.)
- Agent capability registry + persona profiles (`/agent/list` extended schema)
- Memory structuring and threading logic (`/loop`, `/read`, `/train`, etc.)
- Observer summarization layer (`/observer/report`)
- Structured loop logging system (`loop_summary`, `loop_result`, etc.)
- Delegation routing with validation + execution tracking
- Multi-agent project-aware context model (per-agent `state`, `last_active`, etc.)
