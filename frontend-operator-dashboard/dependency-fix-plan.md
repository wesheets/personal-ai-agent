# Dependency Fix Plan for Manus Frontend

## Current Issues

1. React version is 19.0.0 but the frontend was designed for React 18.2
2. @chakra-ui/react is at version 3.15.0 which is likely incompatible with React 18.2
3. @chakra-ui/icons at version 2.2.4 is trying to import "forwardRef" from @chakra-ui/react, causing build errors

## Fix Strategy

1. Uninstall all problematic packages:

   - react
   - react-dom
   - @chakra-ui/react
   - @chakra-ui/icons
   - @emotion/react
   - @emotion/styled
   - framer-motion

2. Clean node_modules and package-lock.json to ensure a fresh start

3. Install compatible versions:

   - react@18.2.0
   - react-dom@18.2.0
   - @chakra-ui/react@2.8.0 (stable version compatible with React 18.2)
   - @chakra-ui/icons@2.0.19 (compatible with @chakra-ui/react 2.x)
   - @emotion/react@11.11.1 (compatible with Chakra UI 2.x)
   - @emotion/styled@11.11.0 (compatible with Chakra UI 2.x)
   - framer-motion@6.5.1 (compatible with Chakra UI 2.x)

4. Verify build process works with the new dependencies

5. Deploy to Railway once build succeeds
