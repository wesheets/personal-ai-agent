# AgentRunner Echo Route Implementation

## Changes Implemented

This update replaces the complex AgentRunner route handler with a simplified echo implementation to diagnose routing issues. The changes were made in response to continued 502 errors despite the previous debugging logs implementation.

### Echo Route Handler Implementation

The entire route handler has been replaced with a simplified echo implementation:

```python
@router.post("/api/modules/agent/run")
async def run_agent_echo(request: Request):
    print("ðŸ“£ AgentRunner echo route was hit!")
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=200,
        content={
            "status": "ok",
            "message": "AgentRunner route is working"
        }
    )
```

### Key Changes

1. **Route Path Update**: Changed from `/run` to `/api/modules/agent/run` to ensure proper routing
2. **Function Simplification**: Removed all complex logic to isolate routing issues
3. **Clear Logging**: Added distinctive log message to confirm when the route is hit
4. **Simple Response**: Returns a basic 200 status code with a success message

### Purpose

This simplified implementation helps diagnose whether the issue is with:

- Route registration and routing configuration
- The handler function itself
- The complex logic within the original handler

By removing all complex logic and dependencies, we can confirm if the route can run a response at all. Once this basic functionality is confirmed, we can begin layering functionality back in.

### Testing Results

The implementation was tested by importing the main application module, which triggers the startup sequence. The test output confirmed that the application starts up correctly with the updated route handler.

When this route is hit in production, we expect to see the "ðŸ“£ AgentRunner echo route was hit!" log message and receive a 200 response with the success message.
