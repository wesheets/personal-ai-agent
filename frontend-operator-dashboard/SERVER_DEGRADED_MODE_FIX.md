# Server Degraded Mode Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary

The server was running in "Degraded Mode" with only `/health` and `/` routes available in Swagger docs. The `/api/modules/memory/summarize` endpoint was returning 404 errors, indicating that the memory router and other modules were not being properly registered during startup.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Commented-out Routes in main.py**: Critical route registrations were commented out in the main.py file
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Several required Python packages were not installed:
   - `openai`
   - `anthropic`
   - `supabase`
3. **Supabase Environment Variables**: The VectorMemorySystem required Supabase credentials that weren't available in the development environment
4. **Port Conflict**: An existing process was using port 8000, preventing the server from starting properly

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Commented-out Routes in main.py

- Uncommented the route registration code in main.py to ensure all routes are properly registered during startup
- Added debug logging to show which routes are being registered

### 2. Installed Missing Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install openai
pip3 install anthropic
pip3 install supabase
```

### 3. Created Mock Environment Variables

Created a .env file with mock Supabase credentials:

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://example.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.mock_key_for_testing
```

### 4. Implemented Mock VectorMemorySystem

Created a mock implementation of the VectorMemorySystem class that:

- Uses in-memory storage instead of connecting to Supabase
- Provides the same interface as the original class
- Returns mock data for all operations
- Avoids any actual API calls to external services

### 5. Used Alternative Port

Started the server on port 8001 instead of 8000 to avoid port conflicts:

```bash
python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

## Verification

1. **Server Startup**: Server successfully starts without errors
2. **Swagger UI**: `/docs` endpoint shows all routes, not just `/health` and `/`
3. **Memory Endpoint Test**: Successfully tested the memory summarize endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/modules/memory/summarize \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"agent_id": "shiva", "type": "training", "limit": 5}'
   ```
   Response:
   ```json
   { "status": "ok", "summary": "No relevant memories to summarize.", "memory_count": 0 }
   ```

## Development Notes

- The mock VectorMemorySystem implementation is suitable for development and testing but should not be used in production
- For production deployment, proper Supabase credentials should be provided
- The server is now fully functional with all routes properly registered and accessible

## Future Improvements

- Add better error handling for missing dependencies
- Implement a more robust startup process that gracefully handles missing environment variables
- Add comprehensive tests for the memory module to prevent regression
