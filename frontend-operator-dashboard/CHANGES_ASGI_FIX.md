# ASGI Entrypoint Fix Implementation

## Changes Implemented

This update fixes the ASGI entrypoint and execution flow in production to resolve 502 errors by ensuring the FastAPI app properly receives and executes live requests.

### Updated uvicorn.run() Entrypoint

Modified the existing uvicorn.run() call at the end of main.py to use the proper format for Railway deployment:

```python
# This is used when running the app directly with Python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run("app.main:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8000)))
```

Key changes:

1. Changed from passing the app object directly to using the string format "app.main:app"
2. Added PORT environment variable support with fallback to 8000
3. Ensured host is set to "0.0.0.0" to bind to all interfaces

### Purpose

These changes fix the root cause of 502 errors in production by:

1. Ensuring the ASGI app is properly served via Uvicorn when Railway runs the container
2. Using the correct string-based module:app reference format required by Uvicorn
3. Binding to the PORT environment variable provided by Railway
4. Binding to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) to accept external connections

### Testing Results

The implementation was tested by:

1. Verifying the application starts up correctly with the modified entrypoint
2. Confirming the PORT environment variable is properly recognized and used

When deployed to Railway, this fix should ensure that:

- The FastAPI app can receive HTTP requests
- Route handlers are properly triggered
- Real responses are returned instead of 502 errors

This addresses the issue where handlers were never executed despite routes being registered correctly during startup.
