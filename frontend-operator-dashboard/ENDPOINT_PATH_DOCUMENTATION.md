# Memory Summarization Endpoint Documentation

## Endpoint Path Clarification

The memory summarization endpoint is correctly implemented and working as expected, but it needs to be accessed at the proper URL path:

**Correct Path:** `/api/modules/memory/summarize`

## Why This Path?

In the application architecture:

1. The route is defined in `memory.py` with `@router.post("/summarize")`
2. The memory router is registered in `main.py` with the prefix `/api/modules/memory`
3. This creates the full endpoint path: `/api/modules/memory/summarize`

## Testing Confirmation

The endpoint has been tested and works correctly with the following curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/modules/memory/summarize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "shiva", "type": "training", "limit": 5}'
```

Response:
```json
{"status":"ok","summary":"No relevant memories to summarize.","memory_count":0}
```

## Postman Configuration

When using Postman, please ensure:

1. The request URL is set to: `http://localhost:8000/api/modules/memory/summarize`
2. The request method is set to: `POST`
3. The request body contains the required JSON payload:
   ```json
   {
     "agent_id": "shiva",
     "type": "training",
     "limit": 5
   }
   ```

No code changes were needed as the endpoint is correctly implemented and registered in the application.
