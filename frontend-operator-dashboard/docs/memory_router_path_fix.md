# Memory Router Path Fix Documentation

## Bug: PROM-247 - `/memory/read` Endpoint 404 Not Found

### Issue Summary

The `/memory/read` endpoint was returning 404 Not Found errors despite successful memory writes and confirmed database persistence.

### Root Cause

The issue was caused by inconsistent endpoint path definitions in `memory.py` combined with how the router was registered in `main.py`:

1. **Inconsistent Path Definitions**:

   - Some endpoints in `memory.py` were defined with a `/memory/` prefix:
     ```python
     @router.post("/memory/write")
     @router.get("/memory/thread")
     ```
   - But the read endpoint was defined without this prefix:
     ```python
     @router.get("/read")
     ```

2. **Router Registration**:

   - The router was registered in `main.py` with:
     ```python
     app.include_router(memory_router, prefix="/api/modules/memory")
     ```

3. **Resulting Paths**:
   - This created inconsistent paths:
     - `/api/modules/memory/read` (for the read endpoint)
     - `/api/modules/memory/memory/write` (for the write endpoint)
     - `/api/modules/memory/memory/thread` (for the thread endpoint)

### Fix Implemented

Two changes were made to ensure consistent path registration:

1. **Updated Endpoint Path in `memory.py`**:

   ```python
   # Changed from:
   @router.get("/read")

   # To:
   @router.get("/memory/read")
   ```

2. **Adjusted Router Registration in `main.py`**:

   ```python
   # Changed from:
   app.include_router(memory_router, prefix="/api/modules/memory")

   # To:
   app.include_router(memory_router, prefix="/api/modules")
   ```

3. **Updated Debug Logging**:
   ```python
   print("ðŸ§  Route defined: /api/modules/memory/read -> read_memory")
   print("ðŸ§  Route defined: /api/modules/memory/write -> memory_write")
   print("ðŸ§  Route defined: /api/modules/memory/thread -> memory_thread")
   print("ðŸ§  Route defined: /api/modules/memory/reflect -> reflect_on_memories")
   print("ðŸ§  Route defined: /api/modules/memory/summarize -> summarize_memories_endpoint")
   ```

### Testing

Verified the fix by:

1. Restarting the FastAPI server with the updated code
2. Testing the `/memory/read` endpoint with a curl command:
   ```
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/modules/memory/read?limit=5
   ```
3. Confirming the endpoint returns a successful response with memory entries

### Impact

This fix ensures that all memory-related endpoints are properly registered with consistent paths:

- `/api/modules/memory/read`
- `/api/modules/memory/write`
- `/api/modules/memory/thread`
- `/api/modules/memory/reflect`
- `/api/modules/memory/summarize`

### Lessons Learned

1. **Consistent Path Naming**: Endpoint paths should follow a consistent pattern within a module
2. **Router Registration**: When registering routers, be aware of how the prefix combines with endpoint paths
3. **Path Debugging**: Explicitly log registered paths during startup to help diagnose routing issues
4. **Testing All Endpoints**: Test all endpoints after router configuration changes, not just the primary ones
