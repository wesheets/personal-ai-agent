# Memory Router Deployment Considerations

## Overview

This document outlines important considerations for deploying the memory router fix across different environments. The fix addresses issues with memory endpoint registration in the FastAPI application.

## Environment-Specific Considerations

### 1. Router Registration Path Changes

The memory router registration has been updated to use a simplified prefix structure:

```python
# Changed from:
app.include_router(memory_router, prefix="/api/modules/memory")

# To:
app.include_router(memory_router, prefix="/api")
```

This change accommodates the fact that endpoint paths in `memory.py` already include the `/memory/` prefix:

```python
@router.get("/memory/read")
@router.post("/memory/write")
@router.get("/memory/thread")
```

### 2. Caching Considerations

In production environments, various caching mechanisms might prevent immediate updates:

- **Module Caching**: Python may cache imported modules
- **WSGI/ASGI Server Caching**: The application server might cache route registrations
- **Reverse Proxy Caching**: Any reverse proxy in front of the application might cache responses

**Mitigation**: After deployment, a full application restart is recommended to ensure all caches are cleared.

### 3. Deployment Verification

The enhanced route logging utility (`app/utils/route_logger.py`) has been added to provide detailed diagnostics during startup. This utility:

- Logs all registered routes with their full paths and methods
- Specifically highlights memory-related routes
- Warns if no memory routes are found

**Verification Steps**:

1. Check application logs after startup
2. Look for the "ROUTE REGISTRATION DIAGNOSTIC" section
3. Verify memory routes are listed under "Memory-specific Routes"

### 4. URL Path Changes

The URL paths for memory endpoints have changed:

- **Old Paths**: `/api/modules/memory/read`, `/api/modules/memory/write`, etc.
- **New Paths**: `/api/memory/read`, `/api/memory/write`, etc.

Any client code or documentation referring to the old paths will need to be updated.

### 5. Backward Compatibility

If backward compatibility with the old paths is required, consider implementing redirect routes:

```python
@app.get("/api/modules/memory/read")
async def legacy_read_memory_redirect():
    return RedirectResponse(url="/api/memory/read")
```

### 6. Monitoring After Deployment

After deploying this fix:

1. Monitor application logs for any route registration errors
2. Check for 404 errors in access logs that might indicate missing routes
3. Verify all memory endpoints are accessible through API tests

## Troubleshooting

If memory routes are still not registered after deployment:

1. **Check Application Logs**: Look for errors during startup, particularly in the route registration phase
2. **Verify File Paths**: Ensure the correct versions of `main.py` and `memory.py` are deployed
3. **Force Module Reload**: In some environments, you may need to force Python to reload modules by modifying the import timestamps
4. **Clear Proxy Caches**: If using a reverse proxy, ensure its cache is cleared
5. **Restart All Components**: Restart the entire application stack, including any worker processes
