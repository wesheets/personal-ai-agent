# Memory Thread Route Fix

## Issue

The `/memory/thread` endpoint was not being registered by FastAPI due to a syntax error in `memory.py`. The error was:

```
‚ùå ERROR DURING STARTUP: unmatched ')' (memory.py, line 615)
```

This caused the entire `/memory/thread` endpoint to fail to load, resulting in 404 Not Found errors when attempting to access it.

## Root Cause

The issue was an extra closing parenthesis on line 590 in `memory.py`, which was introduced during the recent implementation of the debug mode functionality.

The problematic code was:

```python
# Return the thread
return JSONResponse(
    status_code=200,
    content={
        "status": "ok",
        "thread": thread
    }
)
)  # <-- Extra closing parenthesis here
```

## Fix Implemented

The fix was simple - removing the extra closing parenthesis:

```python
# Return the thread
return JSONResponse(
    status_code=200,
    content={
        "status": "ok",
        "thread": thread
    }
)  # <-- Correct syntax
```

## Verification

The fix was verified by:

1. Using Python's `py_compile` module to check the syntax of the file
2. Confirming that the file compiles without errors

## Impact

This fix restores the `/memory/thread` endpoint functionality, including:

- Basic memory thread retrieval
- Goal ID filtering
- Debug mode functionality

## Lessons Learned

1. Always verify syntax after making changes to code
2. Test route registration during development to catch syntax errors early
3. Consider adding automated syntax checking to the CI/CD pipeline

## Related Issues

This fix is related to the previous work on enhancing the memory thread endpoint with debug mode functionality (PROM-247).
