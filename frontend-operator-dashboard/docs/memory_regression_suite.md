# Memory System Regression Suite Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of two critical improvements to the memory system:

1. Rebuilding the Memory DB to match the updated schema
2. Adding a Postman regression test suite with automated guard script

## 1. Memory DB Schema Update

### Problem

The memory system was encountering the following error on `/memory/write`:

```json
"status": "error",
"message": "table memories has no column named type"
```

This confirmed that the existing SQLite DB (`memory.db`) was created before the `type` column (and possibly `goal_id`, `task_id`, etc.) were added to the schema.

### Solution

1. **Deleted the existing DB file**:

   ```bash
   rm /home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/db/memory.db
   ```

2. **Verified the schema includes all required columns**:

   - Examined `memory_schema.sql` and `memory_schema_update.sql`
   - Confirmed the schema includes:
     - `memory_id` (primary key)
     - `agent_id`
     - `memory_type` (which maps to "type" in the view)
     - `content`
     - `timestamp`
     - `metadata`
     - `goal_id` (added in schema update)
     - `task_id`, `status`, `project_id`

3. **Tested memory write with the updated schema**:
   - Created a comprehensive test script (`test_memory_write_updated_schema.py`)
   - Verified that memories can be written with the updated schema
   - Confirmed that the `goal_id` is properly stored and retrievable

### Results

The memory system now correctly handles all required columns, including `type` and `goal_id`. The database is automatically recreated with the correct schema when the application starts, ensuring consistent behavior across all memory endpoints.

## 2. Postman Regression Test Suite

### Implementation

1. **Installed Newman CLI**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g newman
   ```

2. **Created Postman Collection**:

   - Saved the provided Postman collection to `core_tests.postman_collection.json`
   - Updated the `base_url` variable to use port 8000 instead of 8080
   - Collection includes tests for:
     - `/memory/write` (POST)
     - `/memory/read` (GET)
     - `/memory/thread` (GET)

3. **Built Regression Runner Script**:
   - Created `regression_guard.sh` in the project root directory
   - Script runs the Postman collection and checks for test failures
   - Exits with error code if any tests fail, blocking deployment

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "üß™ Running Promethios memory regression tests..."
newman run core_tests.postman_collection.json > postman_output.log

if grep -q "\"failures\": 0" postman_output.log; then
  echo "‚úÖ All memory tests passed!"
else
  echo "‚ùå Memory regression detected! Check postman_output.log"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Test Coverage

The regression suite covers the following critical functionality:

1. **Memory Write**:

   - Verifies successful write operations
   - Confirms persistence verification is working

2. **Memory Read**:

   - Verifies retrieval of memories by agent_id and goal_id
   - Confirms at least one memory is returned

3. **Memory Thread**:
   - Verifies retrieval of memory thread by goal_id
   - Confirms at least one memory is returned in the thread

### Usage

The regression guard script should be run after every push or deploy:

```bash
./regression_guard.sh
```

This will block deployment or module continuation if any test fails, ensuring the memory system remains reliable.

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly enhance the reliability and maintainability of the memory system:

1. The updated schema ensures all required columns are available, preventing errors related to missing columns.
2. The regression test suite provides automated verification of critical memory functionality, catching regressions early.

Together, these changes create a more robust foundation for the memory system, reducing the likelihood of errors and simplifying future development.
