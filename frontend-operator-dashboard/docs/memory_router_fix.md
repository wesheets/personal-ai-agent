# Memory Router Fix Documentation

## Bug: PROM-247 - `/memory/read` Endpoint 404 Not Found

### Issue Summary

The `/memory/read` endpoint was returning 404 Not Found errors despite successful memory writes and confirmed database persistence.

### Root Cause

The memory router was registered with an incorrect prefix in `main.py`:

```python
# Incorrect registration
app.include_router(memory_router, prefix="/api/modules")
```

This caused the `/read` endpoint defined in `memory.py` to be registered at `/api/modules/read` instead of the expected path `/api/modules/memory/read`.

### Fix Implemented

Updated the router registration in `main.py` to use the correct prefix:

```python
# Corrected registration
app.include_router(memory_router, prefix="/api/modules/memory")
```

Also updated the debug log messages to reflect the correct endpoint paths:

```python
print("ðŸ§  Route defined: /api/modules/memory/read -> read_memory")
print("ðŸ§  Route defined: /api/modules/memory/write -> memory_write")
print("ðŸ§  Route defined: /api/modules/memory/reflect -> reflect_on_memories")
print("ðŸ§  Route defined: /api/modules/memory/summarize -> summarize_memories_endpoint")
print("ðŸ§  Route defined: /api/modules/memory/thread -> memory_thread")
```

### Testing

Verified the fix by:

1. Starting the FastAPI server with the updated code
2. Testing the `/memory/read` endpoint with a curl command:
   ```
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/modules/memory/read?limit=5
   ```
3. Confirming the endpoint returns a successful response with memory entries

### Impact

This fix ensures that all memory-related endpoints are properly registered under the `/api/modules/memory` prefix, maintaining consistency with the API design and allowing clients to access memory data as expected.

### Related Endpoints

The following endpoints are now correctly accessible:

- `/api/modules/memory/read` - Read memories with flexible filtering
- `/api/modules/memory/write` - Write new memories
- `/api/modules/memory/thread` - Retrieve memory threads by goal_id, task_id, or memory_trace_id
- `/api/modules/memory/reflect` - Reflect on memories
- `/api/modules/memory/summarize` - Summarize memories

### Lessons Learned

1. Consistent router prefix naming is critical for API endpoint discoverability
2. Router registration should follow the module structure for intuitive API paths
3. Thorough testing of all endpoints after router configuration changes is essential
