# Agent Fallback Module - Direct Delegation Implementation

## Overview

The Agent Fallback module provides functionality for agents to reroute tasks they cannot perform due to skill mismatch, failure, or reflection-based decisions. This document explains the implementation of direct function delegation in the fallback module.

## Problem Addressed

In containerized environments like Railway, internal HTTP requests to localhost or 127.0.0.1 are not reliably accessible. This caused the fallback module to fail with the error "Delegation request failed: All connection attempts failed" when attempting to delegate tasks.

## Solution

The solution replaces HTTP-based delegation with direct function imports, eliminating the network dependency while maintaining all existing functionality.

### Key Changes

1. **Removed HTTP Dependencies**

   - Removed `httpx` import which was used for making HTTP requests
   - Added direct import of `delegate_task` function from `app.modules.delegate`

2. **Created Internal Delegation Function**

   - Implemented `delegate_task_internal` that uses the imported function directly
   - Created a `MockRequest` class to simulate the FastAPI request object
   - Properly handles the response format from the direct function call

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added robust error detection for different response types
   - Maintained the same error reporting format for consistency
   - Preserved all existing validation and memory writing functionality

## Implementation Details

### Before: HTTP-based Delegation

```python
async def delegate_task(from_agent, to_agent, task_id, notes, project_id=None):
    try:
        # Prepare the delegation request
        delegation_request = {
            "from_agent": from_agent,
            "to_agent": to_agent,
            "task": notes,
            "task_id": task_id,
            "project_id": project_id,
            "delegation_depth": 0
        }

        # Call the delegate endpoint
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.post(
                "http://localhost:8000/app/modules/delegate",
                json=delegation_request
            )

        # Check if delegation was successful
        if response.status_code != 200:
            error_detail = response.json().get("message", "Unknown error")
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=response.status_code,
                detail=f"Delegation failed: {error_detail}"
            )

        return response.json()
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        # Handle request errors
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=500,
            detail=f"Delegation request failed: {str(e)}"
        )
```

### After: Direct Function Import

```python
async def delegate_task_internal(from_agent, to_agent, task_id, notes, project_id=None):
    try:
        # Prepare the delegation request
        delegation_request = {
            "from_agent": from_agent,
            "to_agent": to_agent,
            "task": notes,
            "task_id": task_id,
            "project_id": project_id,
            "delegation_depth": 0
        }

        # Create a mock Request object with the delegation request as JSON
        class MockRequest:
            async def json(self):
                return delegation_request

        # Call the delegate_task function directly
        response = await delegate_task(MockRequest())

        # Check if delegation was successful
        if isinstance(response, dict) and response.get("status") == "ok":
            return response
        else:
            # Handle error response from delegate_task
            error_detail = response.get("message", "Unknown error") if isinstance(response, dict) else "Delegation failed"
            status_code = 500

            # If response is a JSONResponse, extract status code and content
            if hasattr(response, "status_code") and hasattr(response, "body"):
                status_code = response.status_code
                try:
                    content = json.loads(response.body)
                    error_detail = content.get("message", error_detail)
                except:
                    pass

            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=status_code,
                detail=f"Delegation failed: {error_detail}"
            )
    except HTTPException:
        # Re-raise HTTP exceptions
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle other errors
        logger.error(f"Delegation failed: {str(e)}")
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=500,
            detail=f"Delegation failed: {str(e)}"
        )
```

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive test cases that verify:

1. Successful fallback with valid agents
2. Proper handling of invalid agents
3. Error handling for delegation failures
4. Direct function call behavior

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Eliminates network dependency that caused failures in containerized environments
2. **Performance**: Reduces overhead by avoiding HTTP request/response cycle
3. **Maintainability**: Simplifies the code by removing external dependencies
4. **Consistency**: Maintains the same interface and error handling patterns

## Future Considerations

1. Consider applying this pattern to other modules that make internal HTTP requests
2. Add more robust error handling for different response types
3. Consider adding metrics to track delegation performance
