# Orchestrator Multi-Modal Planning & Operator Approval System

This document provides an overview of the Orchestrator Multi-Modal Planning & Operator Approval System implementation for Phase 7.0.

## System Overview

The Orchestrator serves as a strategic planning and execution hub with operator approval capabilities. It transforms high-level goals into structured plans, delegates tasks to specialized agents, and provides a checkpoint system for operator oversight.

## Architecture

The system is composed of six main components:

1. **Consultation Flow**: Accepts goals, asks clarifying questions, and proposes plans
2. **Operator Approval Loop**: Enables plan confirmation and task delegation
3. **Credential Intake System**: Securely stores and uses API credentials
4. **Execution Checkpoint Layer**: Allows agents to report completion and await approval
5. **Real-Time Narration**: Logs every major step with natural language commentary
6. **Reflection Memory System**: Summarizes completed phases

## Components

### Consultation Flow (`consultation.py`)

The consultation flow handles the strategic planning phase of the Orchestrator. It:

- Accepts high-level goals from operators
- Asks clarifying questions to understand requirements
- Generates multi-phase plans with agent assignments
- Provides a structured approach to goal refinement

Key classes:

- `ConsultationSession`: Manages a single consultation session
- `ConsultationManager`: Creates and manages consultation sessions

### Operator Approval Loop (`approval.py`)

The approval loop handles the tactical execution phase of the Orchestrator. It:

- Allows operators to approve or modify proposed plans
- Switches to "tactical" mode on confirmation
- Generates goal_id and breaks plans into subgoals
- Delegates tasks to appropriate agents

Key classes:

- `Goal`: Represents a confirmed goal with phases and subgoals
- `ApprovalManager`: Handles plan confirmation and task delegation

### Credential Intake System (`credentials.py`)

The credential intake system securely manages credentials needed for execution. It:

- Gathers hosting provider, GitHub repo/token, domain provider, etc.
- Securely stores credentials with appropriate encryption
- Injects credentials into tools that need them

Key classes:

- `CredentialManager`: Manages secure storage and retrieval of credentials
- `CredentialIntake`: Handles the intake of credentials from operators

### Execution Checkpoint Layer (`checkpoint.py`)

The checkpoint layer allows agents to report task completion and await approval. It:

- Supports both "hard" and "soft" checkpoints
- Halts execution at hard checkpoints until approved
- Allows auto-approval for non-critical checkpoints

Key classes:

- `Checkpoint`: Represents a checkpoint in the execution flow
- `CheckpointManager`: Manages checkpoints and approval status

### Real-Time Narration (`logging.py`)

The real-time narration system provides transparent progress updates. It:

- Logs every major step with natural language commentary
- Maintains a comprehensive action log
- Writes system update and decision memories

Key classes:

- `OrchestratorLogger`: Manages logging and narration for the Orchestrator

### Reflection Memory System (`reflection.py`)

The reflection memory system summarizes completed phases. It:

- Generates reflections after phase completion
- Summarizes agent contributions and outcomes
- Creates both phase and goal reflections

Key classes:

- `ReflectionManager`: Manages the creation and storage of reflection memories

## API Endpoints (`endpoints.py`)

The Orchestrator exposes its functionality through a set of API endpoints:

- `/orchestrator/consult`: Begin a consultation session
- `/orchestrator/respond-to-question`: Answer consultation questions
- `/orchestrator/confirm`: Confirm or reject a proposed plan
- `/orchestrator/credentials`: Store credentials for a goal
- `/orchestrator/checkpoint`: Create a checkpoint for a task
- `/orchestrator/review-status`: List pending checkpoints
- `/orchestrator/approve`: Approve or reject a checkpoint
- `/orchestrator/delegate`: Delegate a task to an agent
- `/orchestrator/create-reflection`: Create a reflection for a completed phase
- `/orchestrator/create-goal-reflection`: Create a reflection for a completed goal
- `/orchestrator/get-action-log`: Get the action log for a goal
- `/orchestrator/get-progress-report`: Get a progress report for a goal

## Testing

The system includes a comprehensive test script (`test_orchestrator.py`) that simulates a complete workflow from consultation to goal completion, testing all major components.

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize the OrchestratorAPI
orchestrator = OrchestratorAPI(memory_writer=memory_writer)

# Start a consultation session
result = orchestrator.consult(operator_id, goal)
session_id = result["session_id"]

# Answer consultation questions
result = orchestrator.respond_to_question(session_id, question_id, answer)

# Confirm the plan
result = orchestrator.confirm(session_id, approved=True)
goal_id = result["goal_id"]

# Store credentials
result = orchestrator.credentials(goal_id, credentials)

# Delegate tasks
result = orchestrator.delegate(goal_id, subgoal_id)

# Create checkpoints
result = orchestrator.checkpoint(
    agent_id="hal",
    goal_id=goal_id,
    subgoal_id=subgoal_id,
    checkpoint_name="task_completed",
    checkpoint_type="hard",
    output_memory_id="memory_123"
)

# Approve checkpoints
result = orchestrator.approve(
    checkpoint_id=checkpoint_id,
    approved=True,
    feedback="Good work!"
)

# Create reflections
result = orchestrator.create_reflection(
    goal_id=goal_id,
    phase_title="Phase Title",
    phase_number=1,
    total_phases=3,
    agent_contributions=agent_contributions,
    outcomes=outcomes,
    start_time=start_time,
    end_time=end_time
)
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the Orchestrator system:

1. **Multi-operator support**: Allow multiple operators to collaborate on a goal
2. **Advanced plan visualization**: Provide visual representations of plans and progress
3. **Predictive analytics**: Use historical data to predict task durations and resource needs
4. **Integration with external project management tools**: Connect with tools like Jira, Asana, etc.
5. **Enhanced security measures**: Implement more robust credential encryption and access controls
