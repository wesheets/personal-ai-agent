# Promethios Operator Dashboard - Phase 8.0.A Splash Gate

This README provides instructions for deploying and configuring the Promethios Operator Dashboard Splash Gate implementation.

## Overview

The Splash Gate serves as a secure entry point to the Promethios Operator Dashboard. It features:

- Dark-mode splash screen with Promethios logo
- Typed animation slogan: "The fire has been lit. Operator input required."
- Secure login form with authentication
- Protected routes for authenticated users only
- Easter egg functionality (try typing "I AM PROMETHIOS")

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Vercel account with access to the personal-ai-agent project

### Deployment Steps

1. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   - Copy `.env.production.example` to `.env.production`
   - Set your desired operator credentials:
     ```
     VITE_API_URL=https://web-production-2639.up.railway.app
     VITE_OPERATOR_USERNAME=admin
     VITE_OPERATOR_PASSWORD=securekey
     ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:

   - Log in to your Vercel account
   - Import the `/frontend-operator-dashboard` directory as a new project
   - Link it to the existing personal-ai-agent project
   - Set the environment variables from your `.env.production` file
   - Deploy the project

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Access the deployed URL
   - Confirm the splash page loads with logo and animation
   - Test login with your configured credentials
   - Verify redirect to dashboard after successful login
   - Test route protection by trying to access /dashboard directly

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Enhance Dashboard Functionality**:

   - Implement real data integration with the API
   - Add operator control panels and monitoring widgets
   - Develop user management features

2. **Security Enhancements**:

   - Implement proper JWT authentication with token refresh
   - Add session timeout functionality
   - Consider adding two-factor authentication

3. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Refine dashboard layout for better information hierarchy
   - Add loading states and transitions
   - Implement dark/light mode toggle

## Technical Notes

- The application uses React with TypeScript
- Styling is implemented with TailwindCSS
- Authentication currently uses localStorage for token storage
- The typed animation effect uses the typewriter-effect library
- All routes except the splash page are protected and require authentication

## Troubleshooting

- If the login doesn't work, verify your environment variables are correctly set in Vercel
- For routing issues, ensure Vercel is configured to handle client-side routing (vercel.json is included)
- If styles aren't applying, check that the TailwindCSS build process completed successfully
