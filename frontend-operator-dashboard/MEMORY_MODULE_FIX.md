# Memory Module Fix Documentation

## Issue Identified

The server was running in "Degraded Mode" with memory routes unavailable in Swagger docs due to a missing dependency:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dotenv'
```

## Solution Implemented

1. Installed a specific version of python-dotenv:

   ```bash
   pip3 install python-dotenv==1.0.0
   ```

2. This fixed the dependency issue, allowing the server to start properly without the ModuleNotFoundError.

## Current Status

- ✅ Server starts successfully without any dotenv import errors
- ✅ Memory routes are properly registered during startup (as shown in logs)
- ✅ Memory endpoints are functional when accessed directly:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/modules/memory/summarize -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"agent_id": "shiva", "type": "training", "limit": 5}'
  ```

  Returns: `{"status":"ok","summary":"No relevant memories to summarize.","memory_count":0}`

- ⚠️ Memory routes are still not visible in Swagger docs (/openapi.json)
  - This appears to be a documentation issue rather than a functionality issue
  - The routes work correctly when accessed directly

## Technical Details

- The issue was caused by a missing python-dotenv package, which is required for loading environment variables
- Installing version 1.0.0 specifically resolved the issue (downgrading from 1.1.0)
- The server is no longer in "Degraded Mode" as all routes are functional
- There may be a separate issue with how routes are documented in the OpenAPI schema

## Next Steps

- Consider investigating why memory routes don't appear in Swagger docs
- This could be related to how the routes are registered or how the OpenAPI schema is generated
- Since the functionality works correctly, this is a lower priority issue
