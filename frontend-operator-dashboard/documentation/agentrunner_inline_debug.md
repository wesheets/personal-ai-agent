# AgentRunner Inline Debug Patch Documentation

## Overview

This document details the changes made to implement inline execution debug logging in the AgentRunner route. The backend was returning 502 errors with no logs in Railway after the POST request, suggesting that the route handler was crashing before any logging occurred.

## Problem

- `/api/modules/agent/run` was returning 502 errors
- No logs appeared in Railway after the POST request
- Even the "üî• AgentRunner route invoked" message was not appearing
- This confirmed that `run_agent()` was not executing or was failing before logging

## Implemented Solution

### 1. Replaced Route Definition with Inline Debug Version

Completely replaced the existing route handler with a simplified version that includes inline execution debug logging:

```python
@router.post("/run")
async def run_agent_endpoint(request: Request):
    print("üî• AgentRunner endpoint received a request")
    logger.info("üî• AgentRunner endpoint received a request")

    start_time = time.time()

    try:
        # Parse request body
        body = await request.json()
        print("üß† Parsed body:", body)
        logger.info(f"Parsed request body with {len(body.get('messages', []))} messages")

        # ... rest of implementation ...
```

### 2. Added Direct CoreForgeAgent Import

Implemented direct import of CoreForgeAgent with fallback mechanism:

```python
# Import CoreForgeAgent directly
try:
    print("üß† Attempting to import CoreForgeAgent")
    from app.modules.agent_runner import CoreForgeAgent
    print("‚úÖ Successfully imported CoreForgeAgent")
except ImportError:
    try:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è First import attempt failed, trying alternate import path")
        from app.core.forge import CoreForgeAgent
        print("‚úÖ Successfully imported CoreForgeAgent from alternate path")
    except ImportError as e:
        error_msg = f"Failed to import CoreForgeAgent: {str(e)}"
        print(f"‚ùå {error_msg}")
        logger.error(error_msg)
        logger.error(traceback.format_exc())
        return JSONResponse(
            status_code=500,
            content={
                "status": "error",
                "message": error_msg
            }
        )
```

### 3. Added Detailed Request Parsing Logging

Implemented explicit logging for request parsing:

```python
# Parse request body
body = await request.json()
print("üß† Parsed body:", body)
logger.info(f"Parsed request body with {len(body.get('messages', []))} messages")
```

### 4. Implemented Comprehensive Try/Except with Error Logging

Wrapped all logic in a comprehensive try/except block with detailed error logging:

```python
try:
    # Implementation logic...
except Exception as e:
    # Handle any unexpected errors
    error_msg = f"Error in AgentRunner endpoint: {str(e)}"
    print(f"‚ùå AgentRunner exception: {str(e)}")
    logger.error(error_msg)
    logger.error(traceback.format_exc())

    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=500,
        content={
            "status": "error",
            "message": str(e),
            "agent_id": "Core.Forge"
        }
    )
```

### 5. Created Test Script

Implemented a comprehensive test script to verify the patched route:

- Test for successful execution
- Test for error handling with invalid payload
- Detailed logging of request and response

## Expected Outcomes

This implementation ensures that:

1. We can confirm the route is actually executing with the entry confirmation logging
2. We can see whether the request body is parsed successfully
3. We can determine whether agent import is crashing
4. We can verify whether agent.run() is executed or not

## Success Criteria

- Logs appear immediately after sending a POST to /api/modules/agent/run
- If import fails ‚Üí "‚ùå AgentRunner exception:" with traceback is shown
- If GPT works ‚Üí "‚úÖ CoreForgeAgent returned:" log appears with the response
- If OpenAI key is missing ‚Üí structured 500 error is returned
- 502 errors no longer appear ‚Äî replaced with 500 or 200 responses

## Note

This patch is temporary for debugging purposes only. Once we identify the failure line, we'll rewrap this logic into the original run_agent() function structure.
