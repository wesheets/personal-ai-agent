# Route Activation Fix Documentation

## Overview

This document details the fixes implemented to resolve 404 Not Found and 422 Unprocessable Entity errors across various API endpoints in the Promethios system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. System Summary Parameter Handling

**Problem:** The `/api/system/summary` POST endpoint was only accepting `project_id` as a query parameter, causing 422 errors when clients attempted to send it in the request body.

**Solution:** Modified the endpoint to accept `project_id` from either source:
- Updated function signature to use `Query(None)` instead of `Query(...)` to make the parameter optional
- Added support for extracting `project_id` from the request body using `Body(None)`
- Implemented logic to use query parameter if provided, otherwise use body project_id
- Added proper error handling when no project_id is provided from either source

### 2. Project Start Router Registration

**Problem:** The project start router was failing to register with the error "Failed to register project start router: module 'app.api.project.start' has no attribute 'routes'".

**Solution:** Fixed the import statement in main.py:
- Changed from `from app.api.project import start` to `from app.api.project.start import router as start_router`
- Updated the router registration to use `start_router` instead of `start`
- This ensures the router object is properly imported and registered

### 3. Router Prefix Clarity

**Problem:** Some routers had prefix declarations in their APIRouter() constructor, which were then combined with prefixes in main.py, resulting in incorrect paths like `/api/agent/agent/*`.

**Solution:** Audited all router registrations to ensure:
- No double-prefixing occurs
- All routers are registered with the correct prefixes
- All endpoints are properly accessible via their intended paths

## Testing

All routes have been tested to ensure they return 200 OK responses:
- GET /api/agent/run
- GET /api/system/status
- GET /api/system/summary
- POST /api/system/summary (with project_id in body)
- GET /api/project/start
- GET /api/memory/read
- GET /api/memory/thread

## Impact

These fixes ensure:
1. All cognitive agent and system endpoints are properly accessible via API
2. The server boots cleanly without 404 errors
3. The Playground reflection loop is now supported
4. The CRM cognition loop is now functional
5. The system is ready for recording, demoing, and vertical launch
