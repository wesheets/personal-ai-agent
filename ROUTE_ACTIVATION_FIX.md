# Route Registration Recovery Documentation

## Problem Summary

The server was starting correctly (health endpoint was working), but all core endpoints were returning 404 Not Found errors, including:
- POST /api/agent/run
- GET /api/system/status
- POST /api/system/summary
- GET /api/project/start

## Root Cause

The issue was identified in the router registration in `main.py`. The routers were being registered with a generic `/api` prefix instead of specific prefixes like `/api/agent`, `/api/system`, and `/api/project`. This caused a mismatch between the expected endpoint paths and the actual registered paths.

For example:
- `agent_router` was registered with `prefix="/api"` but the routes in `agent_routes.py` were defined with paths like `/agent/run`
- `system_router` was registered with `prefix="/api"` but the routes in `system_routes.py` were defined with a router prefix of `/system`
- `project_routes_router` was registered with `prefix="/api"` but the routes in `project_routes.py` were defined with paths like `/project/state`

## Changes Made

1. Updated router registrations to use specific prefixes:
   - Changed `app.include_router(agent_router, prefix="/api")` to `app.include_router(agent_router, prefix="/api/agent")`
   - Changed `app.include_router(system_router, prefix="/api")` to `app.include_router(system_router, prefix="/api/system")`
   - Changed `app.include_router(project_routes_router, prefix="/api")` to `app.include_router(project_router, prefix="/api/project")`

2. Renamed `project_routes_router` to `project_router` for consistency

3. Added debug router exposure code to print all registered routes during startup:
   ```python
   # Debug Router Exposure - Print all registered routes
   print("ðŸ“¡ ROUTES REGISTERED ON STARTUP:")
   for route in app.routes:
       print(f"ðŸ§  ROUTE: {route.path} {route.methods}")
   ```

## Validation

The fix ensures that the following endpoints are now properly accessible:

| Route File | Endpoint | Method |
|------------|----------|--------|
| agent_routes.py | /api/agent/run | POST |
| system_routes.py | /api/system/status | GET |
| system_routes.py | /api/system/summary | POST + GET |
| project_routes.py | /api/project/start | POST |
| log_routes.py | /api/system/log | GET |

## Benefits

1. All cognitive agent and system endpoints are now properly registered and accessible via API
2. The server boots cleanly without 404 errors
3. The Playground reflection loop is now supported
4. The system is ready for recording, demoing, and vertical launch
