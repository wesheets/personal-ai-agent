# AgentRunner Hardcoded Failsafe Route Implementation

## Changes Implemented

This update implements a hardcoded failsafe route directly in main.py to bypass router issues with the AgentRunner endpoint. Despite previous fixes to the route prefix collision, the route handler was still not being invoked, suggesting deeper issues with the router registration or execution.

### Failsafe Route Implementation

Added a direct route handler in main.py to bypass the router entirely:

```python
# Failsafe route handler defined directly in main.py to bypass router issues
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi import Request

@app.post("/api/modules/agent/run")
async def agentrunner_failsafe(request: Request):
    print("🛠️ AgentRunner Failsafe Route HIT")
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=200,
        content={
            "status": "ok",
            "message": "Failsafe AgentRunner route is alive"
        }
    )
```

### Commented Out Existing Route Handler

To prevent any conflicts or overrides, the existing route handler in agent.py has been temporarily commented out:

```python
# Temporarily commented out as per failsafe implementation requirements
"""
@router.post("/run")
async def run_agent_echo(request: Request):
    print("📣 AgentRunner echo route was hit!")
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=200,
        content={
            "status": "ok",
            "message": "AgentRunner route is working"
        }
    )
"""
```

### Purpose

This implementation eliminates router uncertainty and provides a known-working endpoint by:
1. Bypassing the router entirely
2. Defining the route directly in the main FastAPI app
3. Removing potential conflicts with other route handlers

### Testing Results

The implementation was tested by importing the main application module, which triggers the startup sequence. The test output confirmed that the application starts up correctly with the failsafe route implementation.

When this route is hit in production, we expect to see the "🛠️ AgentRunner Failsafe Route HIT" log message and receive a 200 response with the success message, confirming that the route is now correctly registered and accessible at `/api/modules/agent/run`.
