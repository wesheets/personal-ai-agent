# System Status Endpoint Fix

## Problem
The `/api/system/status` endpoint was returning a 404 error when accessed with:
```
GET /api/system/status?project_id=demo_001
```

The backend logs showed that `/api/system/*` was registered correctly, but the specific `/status` subroute was missing.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Endpoint
Added the missing `/status` endpoint to `routes/system_routes.py`:
```python
@router.get("/status")
def get_system_status(project_id: str = Query(..., description="Project ID to get status for")):
    """
    Get the current system status for a project.
    
    This endpoint returns the current project state including loop count,
    status, and other relevant information.
    
    Args:
        project_id: The project ID to get status for
        
    Returns:
        Dict containing the project state
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

### 2. Added Project State Integration
- Imported the `read_project_state` function from `app.modules.project_state`
- Added proper error handling for when the project state module is not available
- Added validation to check if the project state exists for the given project ID

### 3. Added Debug Logging
Added debug logging in `main.py` to print all registered system routes:
```python
# Debug line to print all system routes
print("üìã DEBUG: Listing all system routes after mounting:")
for route in app.routes:
    if "/api/system" in route.path:
        print(f"üîç SYSTEM ROUTE: {route.path} {route.methods}")
```

### 4. Added Comprehensive Error Handling
- Added proper error handling for all potential failure points
- Added detailed error messages with status codes
- Added logging with both logger.info() and print() statements
- Included stack traces for exceptions

## Expected Behavior

With these changes, the system should now:

1. Properly register the `/api/system/status` endpoint
2. Return a 200 OK response with the project state JSON when accessed
3. Provide appropriate error responses for invalid project IDs or other issues
4. Log detailed information about the request and response

## Testing

The endpoint can be tested with:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/system/status?project_id=demo_001"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "System status retrieved",
  "project_id": "demo_001",
  "project_state": {
    // Project state details here
  }
}
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add caching for frequently accessed project states
2. Add more detailed status information beyond the basic project state
3. Add authentication and authorization checks for accessing project status
