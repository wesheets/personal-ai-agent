# Personal AI Agent UI Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for the UI of the Personal AI Agent system. The UI will provide an intuitive interface for users to interact with the various agent types and memory functionality provided by the backend API.

## UI Technology Stack
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code
- **Chakra UI**: Component library for consistent design
- **React Router**: For navigation between different sections
- **Axios**: For API requests
- **React Query**: For managing server state
- **Vite**: For fast development and building

## UI Components Structure

### Core Components
1. **Layout Components**
   - AppShell: Main layout container
   - Sidebar: Navigation between different agent types
   - Header: App title, user info, settings
   - Footer: Version info, links

2. **Agent Interaction Components**
   - AgentChat: Main chat interface for interacting with agents
   - MessageList: Display conversation history
   - MessageInput: Input for user messages
   - AgentResponse: Formatted display of agent responses
   - AgentSelector: Switch between different agent types

3. **Memory Components**
   - MemoryBrowser: View and search stored memories
   - MemoryItem: Display individual memory items
   - MemorySearch: Search interface for memories

4. **Settings Components**
   - AgentSettings: Configure agent behavior
   - ModelSelector: Choose between available models
   - APISettings: Configure API endpoints

5. **Utility Components**
   - LoadingIndicator: Show loading states
   - ErrorDisplay: Show error messages
   - Toast: Notification system

### Pages
1. **Home Page**: Dashboard with quick access to all agents
2. **Agent Pages**: Dedicated pages for each agent type
   - Builder Agent
   - Ops Agent
   - Research Agent
   - Memory Agent
3. **Memory Page**: Interface for browsing and searching memories
4. **Settings Page**: Configure application settings

## State Management
- React Context for global state
- React Query for server state
- Local state for component-specific state

## API Integration
The UI will integrate with the following backend API endpoints:
- `/agent/{agent_type}`: For agent interactions
- `/memory/add`: For adding memories
- `/memory/search`: For searching memories
- `/system/models`: For retrieving available models

## Responsive Design
The UI will be responsive and work well on:
- Desktop
- Tablet
- Mobile devices

## Deployment Strategy
- Build static assets with Vite
- Deploy to GitHub Pages or Vercel for public access
- Configure CORS on backend to allow requests from the deployed frontend

## Future Enhancements
- File upload interface for document processing
- Visualization of agent thought processes
- Dark/light theme toggle
- User authentication and personalized experiences
