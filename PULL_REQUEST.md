# Pull Request: Enable Agents to Read from project_state

## Description
This pull request implements project state awareness for agents in the personal-ai-agent system. This feature enables agents to access the project state when executing tasks, allowing them to know what's already been built, skip duplicate work, improve task planning, and reflect on team progress.

## Changes Made
1. Updated import statement in agent_runner.py to include the `read_project_state` function
2. Added code to read the project state at the beginning of each agent runner function
3. Implemented conditional execution logic for each agent type:
   - HAL: Skips work when README.md already exists
   - NOVA: Blocks when HAL hasn't run
   - CRITIC: Blocks when NOVA hasn't run
   - ASH: Goes on hold when project is not ready for deployment
4. Included project state in all agent responses, including error handling cases

## Testing
The implementation was tested with various scenarios to verify that:
- Agents skip already-built components
- Agents reference teammates' work
- Project state context is included in output

All tests pass successfully, confirming that the implementation meets the requirements.

## Documentation
- Created DOCUMENTATION.md with detailed implementation information
- Created VALIDATION.md to verify requirements are met
