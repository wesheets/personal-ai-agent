# Pull Request: Phase 6.1 Agent Timing & Synchronization

## Overview
This PR implements the Phase 6.1 Agent Timing & Synchronization features, which enable better coordination between agents, intelligent recovery from blocked states, and improved state management.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Agent Retry and Recovery Flow
- Created `agent_retry.py` module with functions for registering blocked agents and checking for unblocked agents
- Integrated retry functionality with all agent implementations in `agent_runner.py`
- Added support for `blocked_due_to` and `unblock_condition` fields

### 2. Project State Watch Hooks
- Created `project_state_watch.py` module with subscription functionality
- Implemented polling mechanism for project state changes
- Added event listeners for state updates
- Implemented subscription functionality for monitoring changes

### 3. Post-Block Memory Updates
- Created `memory_block_writer.py` module for logging block information
- Added required `blocked_due_to` and `unblock_condition` fields
- Integrated with all agent implementations in `agent_runner.py`
- Implemented memory storage for block and unblock events

### 4. Passive Reflection Engine
- Created `passive_reflection.py` module with reflection functionality
- Implemented orchestrator recheck mode
- Added agent re-evaluation logic
- Integrated with all agent implementations in `agent_runner.py`

### 5. Intelligent Reset Flags
- Created `reset_flags.py` module with reset functionality
- Created reset state API endpoints in `reset_routes.py`
- Implemented agent-specific reset functionality
- Added support for both full and partial resets

### 6. API Endpoints
- Created API endpoints for all required functionality
- Added `/api/reset/agent`, `/api/reset/project`, and `/api/reset/status` endpoints
- Implemented proper error handling for all endpoints

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test script (`test_phase_6_1.py`) to test all implemented features
- Validated implementation against requirements
- Documented all changes in `DOCUMENTATION.md` and `VALIDATION_REPORT.md`

## Changes Made
- New modules:
  - `app/modules/agent_retry.py`
  - `app/modules/project_state_watch.py`
  - `app/modules/memory_block_writer.py`
  - `app/modules/passive_reflection.py`
  - `app/modules/reset_flags.py`
  - `routes/reset_routes.py`
- Modified modules:
  - `app/modules/agent_runner.py` (updated all agent implementations)
- Documentation:
  - `DOCUMENTATION.md`
  - `VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
  - `test_phase_6_1.py`

## How to Test
1. Run the test script: `python test_phase_6_1.py`
2. Test API endpoints:
   - Reset agent state: `POST /api/reset/agent`
   - Reset project state: `POST /api/reset/project`
   - Get reset status: `GET /api/reset/status?project_id=demo_project_001`
3. Test agent coordination by running agents in sequence and observing blocking/unblocking behavior

## Additional Notes
The implementation provides a solid foundation for agent coordination and synchronization in the personal AI agent system. Future improvements could include:
- Enhanced error handling for edge cases
- More sophisticated dependency tracking
- UI components for visualizing agent state and dependencies
