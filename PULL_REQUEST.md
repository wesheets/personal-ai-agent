# Pull Request: Fix CRITIC Logger Crash

## Description
This PR fixes an issue where the CRITIC agent was crashing due to undefined logger references. When attempting to log feedback or errors, it was calling `logger` without a proper import or definition.

## Changes Made
- Added dedicated logger definition for the CRITIC agent
- Implemented safety wrappers around all logger calls
- Enhanced response structure to include all required fields
- Modified the CRITIC agent to update project state even when blocked

## Testing
Created two test scripts to verify the fix:
1. `test_critic_logger.py`: Tests basic logger functionality and response structure
2. `test_critic_payload.py`: Tests with the specific payload from the requirements

Both tests confirm that:
- No logger errors occur
- All required fields are present in the response
- Project state is properly updated
- The agent correctly handles blocked scenarios

## Validation
The implementation meets all requirements specified in the task:
- ✅ Logger definition added
- ✅ Safety wrappers implemented
- ✅ Memory logging functionality verified
- ✅ Project state inclusion confirmed
- ✅ Structured response with required fields
- ✅ No logger errors

## Documentation
See `CRITIC_LOGGER_FIX.md` for detailed documentation of the changes.

## Related Issues
