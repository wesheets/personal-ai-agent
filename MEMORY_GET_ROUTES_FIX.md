# Memory GET Routes Fix Documentation

## Issue Overview
Two memory-related GET endpoints were returning 404 Not Found errors:
- `/api/memory/read`
- `/api/memory/thread`

## Root Cause Analysis
After examining the code, the following issues were identified:

1. The `/read` endpoint was not using the required `Query(...)` parameter for `project_id`
2. The memory reader functions were not properly imported at the module level
3. The `/thread` endpoint was trying to import the function inside the handler instead of using the module-level import

## Changes Made

1. Added proper imports at the module level:
   ```python
   from app.memory.memory_reader import get_memory_for_project, get_memory_thread_for_project
   ```

2. Updated the memory_read endpoint to use Query(...) for the project_id parameter:
   ```python
   @router.get("/read")
   async def memory_read(project_id: str = Query(..., description="Project identifier")):
   ```

3. Implemented proper error handling for both endpoints

4. Simplified the memory_thread_get implementation to use the imported function directly

## Verification
- Confirmed that the memory_router is correctly registered in main.py with prefix="/api/memory"
- The endpoints should now correctly respond to:
  - GET /api/memory/read?project_id=demo_001
  - GET /api/memory/thread?project_id=demo_001

## Impact
This fix unblocks full system cognition by ensuring all memory operations (read/thread) pass 200 OK.
