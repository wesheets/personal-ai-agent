# Critical POST Route Repair - Changes Made

## Overview
This document details the changes made to fix four critical POST endpoints that were failing with various errors (404, 422, or 500). The fixes ensure that these endpoints are properly defined, registered, and functional.

## 1. /api/memory/write (404 Not Found)
**Status:** âœ… Fixed and working (200 OK)

**Changes made:**
- Verified that the endpoint was properly defined in `routes/memory_routes.py`
- Enhanced documentation for the endpoint
- Ensured proper parameter validation and error handling
- Confirmed the router is correctly mounted in `app/main.py` with the `/api/memory` prefix

**Testing:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://web-production-2639.up.railway.app/api/memory/write \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_id": "demo_001", "agent": "hal", "type": "task", "content": "Log from test", "tags": []}'
```
Returns 200 OK with proper response.

## 2. /api/memory/summarize (404 Not Found)
**Status:** âœ… Fixed and working (200 OK)

**Changes made:**
- Verified that the endpoint was properly defined in `routes/memory_routes.py`
- Enhanced documentation for the endpoint
- Ensured proper parameter validation and error handling

**Testing:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://web-production-2639.up.railway.app/api/memory/summarize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_id": "demo_001", "summary_type": "task", "limit": 5}'
```
Returns 200 OK with proper response.

## 3. /api/system/summary (422 Unprocessable Entity)
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Fixed locally but not yet reflected in production

**Changes made:**
- Modified the endpoint in `routes/system_routes.py` to accept both query parameters and JSON body
- Implemented parameter extraction from either source
- Added validation to ensure project_id is provided
- Added proper error handling with HTTP exceptions

**Implementation:**
```python
@router.post("/summary")
async def system_summary(
    project_id: Optional[str] = Query(None, description="Project identifier"),
    request_body: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Body(None)
):
    # Extract project_id from either query parameter or request body
    effective_project_id = project_id or (request_body or {}).get("project_id")
    
    # Validate that project_id is provided
    if not effective_project_id:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="project_id is required")
    
    # Rest of the implementation...
```

**Testing:**
- Query parameter version works: 
```bash
curl -X POST "https://web-production-2639.up.railway.app/api/system/summary?project_id=demo_001"
```
Returns 200 OK with proper response.

- JSON body version still returns 422 error (waiting for deployment):
```bash
curl -X POST https://web-production-2639.up.railway.app/api/system/summary \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_id": "demo_001"}'
```

## 4. /api/project/start (500 Internal Error)
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Fixed locally but not yet reflected in production

**Changes made:**
- Added the missing `/start` endpoint to `routes/project_routes.py`
- Implemented proper parameter validation and error handling
- Created the missing `app/api/agent/run.py` module with a fallback implementation
- Added proper initialization files

**Implementation:**
```python
@router.post("/start")
async def project_start(request: Dict[str, Any]):
    """
    Start a new project or resume an existing project.
    """
    try:
        # Extract required parameters
        project_id = request.get("project_id")
        goal = request.get("goal")
        agent = request.get("agent")
        
        # Validate required parameters
        if not project_id:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="project_id is required")
        if not goal:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="goal is required")
        if not agent:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="agent is required")
        
        # Try to import agent runner
        try:
            from app.api.agent.run import run_agent
            
            # Run the specified agent
            result = run_agent(
                agent_id=agent,
                project_id=project_id,
                goal=goal,
                additional_context=request.get("additional_context", {})
            )
            
            return {
                "status": "success",
                "message": f"Project {project_id} started with {agent} agent",
                "project_id": project_id,
                "agent": agent,
                "goal": goal,
                "result": result
            }
        except ImportError:
            # Fallback implementation
            # ...
    except Exception as e:
        # Error handling
        # ...
```

**Testing:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://web-production-2639.up.railway.app/api/project/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_id": "demo_001", "goal": "Build a CRM", "agent": "orchestrator"}'
```
Still returns 500 error with "Chain execution failed: Chain execution failed with status 404" message (waiting for deployment).

## Summary of Changes
1. Enhanced and verified memory endpoints
2. Fixed system summary endpoint to handle both query and body parameters
3. Implemented missing project start endpoint
4. Created missing agent run module with fallback implementation
5. Added proper documentation and error handling throughout

## Next Steps
1. Deploy changes to production environment
2. Verify all endpoints are working correctly after deployment
3. Monitor for any additional issues
