# AgentRunner Route Handler Trace & Execution Validation

## Changes Implemented

This update adds comprehensive debugging logs to trace and validate the execution of the `/api/modules/agent/run` route handler. These changes will help diagnose the issue where the route appears in logs but no logs are shown when it is triggered from Postman, indicating that the function is either not being called or is crashing immediately.

### 1. Global Route Registration Logs in main.py

Added explicit logging when the AgentRunner module router is included:

```python
# Include only the isolated AgentRunner module router
print("🔄 Including isolated AgentRunner module router...")
print("📡 Including AgentRunner module router from /api/modules/agent.py")
app.include_router(agent_module_router, prefix="/api")
app.include_router(health_router)  # Include health router without prefix
print("✅ Isolated AgentRunner module router included")
```

This confirms that the router from `/api/modules/agent.py` is being properly included in the FastAPI application.

### 2. Module Import Confirmation in agent.py

Added module load confirmation at the top of the file:

```python
print("📁 Loaded: agent.py (AgentRunner route file)")
```

This confirms that the agent.py module is being properly imported and executed during application startup.

### 3. Route Handler Execution Logs

Updated the log message in the route handler to match the required format:

```python
@router.post("/run")
async def run_agent_endpoint(request: Request):
    print("🔥 AgentRunner endpoint HIT")
    logger.info("🔥 AgentRunner endpoint HIT")
    # ...
```

This will clearly indicate when the endpoint is actually being called.

### 4. Route Definition Confirmation

Added explicit logging after the router is defined:

```python
# Create router
router = APIRouter(prefix="/modules/agent", tags=["Agent Modules"])
print("🧠 Route defined: /api/modules/agent/run -> run_agent_endpoint")
```

This confirms that the route is being properly defined and associated with the correct handler function.

## Testing Results

The implementation was tested by importing the main application module, which triggers the startup sequence. The test output confirmed that all the debugging logs appear correctly:

```
🚀 Starting Promethios OS...
🔄 Initializing agent registry...
✅ Agent registry initialized with 0 agents
📁 Loaded: agent.py (AgentRunner route file)
🧠 Route defined: /api/modules/agent/run -> run_agent_endpoint
✅ Environment variables loaded
✅ Logging configured
✅ FastAPI app initialized
✅ CORS middleware added
🔄 Including isolated AgentRunner module router...
📡 Including AgentRunner module router from /api/modules/agent.py
✅ Isolated AgentRunner module router included
✅ Isolated mode startup complete
```

## Expected Outcomes

With these changes, when the `/api/modules/agent/run` endpoint is triggered from Postman:

1. If the route handler is properly registered and connected, we should see the "🔥 AgentRunner endpoint HIT" log
2. If there's an issue with the route registration, we'll be able to compare the startup logs with the runtime behavior
3. If the handler is crashing, we'll see the initial hit log but then an error

These logs will provide the necessary visibility to diagnose and fix the 502 error issue.
