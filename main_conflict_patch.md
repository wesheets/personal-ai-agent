# Main.py Conflict Resolution Summary

## Conflict Analysis

I identified the following differences between the two versions of `main.py`:

### Main Branch Version
- Simple FastAPI initialization
- Only debug_routes router included
- Basic root and health endpoints
- No middleware or exception handling

### fix/memory-module-and-route-maps Branch Version
- Comprehensive implementation with detailed documentation
- Logging configuration
- CORS middleware
- All five required routers properly included
- Custom docs endpoint
- Global exception handler
- Server startup code

## Resolution Decisions

1. **Base Structure**: Used the comprehensive structure from the fix/memory-module-and-route-maps branch as it provides better organization, documentation, and error handling.

2. **Router Registration**: Ensured all five required routers are included:
   - core_router
   - loop_router
   - agent_router
   - persona_router
   - debug_routes.router

3. **Prefix Cleanup**: Maintained the clean URL structure without the `/api/` prefix for all routes.

4. **Health Endpoint**: Preserved the health endpoint from the main branch but enhanced it with proper async definition and documentation.

5. **Documentation**: Kept the custom docs endpoint for better API documentation.

6. **Error Handling**: Retained the global exception handler for improved error reporting.

## Testing Results

- Application starts successfully without any import errors
- All routers are properly registered
- No duplicate includes or broken imports
- Clean structure maintained for readability and future scaling

The merged solution successfully combines the best elements of both versions while ensuring all requirements are met.
