# Main.py Conflict Resolution Summary (Backend-Only)

## Conflict Analysis

I identified the following differences between the two versions of `main.py`:

### Main Branch Version
- Simple FastAPI initialization
- Only debug_routes router included
- Basic root and health endpoints
- No middleware or exception handling

### fix/memory-module-and-route-maps Branch Version
- Comprehensive implementation with detailed documentation
- Logging configuration
- CORS middleware
- All five required routers properly included
- Custom docs endpoint
- Global exception handler
- Server startup code

## Resolution Decisions

1. **Base Structure**: Used the comprehensive structure from the fix/memory-module-and-route-maps branch as it provides better organization, documentation, and error handling.

2. **Router Registration**: Ensured all five required routers are included:
   - core_router
   - loop_router
   - agent_router
   - persona_router
   - debug_routes.router

3. **Backend Focus**: Confirmed the implementation is already focused exclusively on backend API functionality with no frontend/UI-specific code that needed to be removed.

4. **Prefix Cleanup**: Maintained the clean URL structure without the `/api/` prefix for most routes (except debug routes which retain the prefix).

5. **Documentation**: Kept the custom docs endpoint for better API documentation.

6. **Error Handling**: Retained the global exception handler for improved error reporting.

## Testing Results

- Application starts successfully without any import errors
- All routers are properly registered
- No duplicate includes or broken imports
- Clean structure maintained for readability and future scaling
- OpenAPI schema shows 29 routes covering all required functionality:
  - Core routes (/, /health, /system/status)
  - Loop routes (/loop/trace, /loop/reset, /loop/persona-reflect)
  - Agent routes (/analyze-prompt, /generate-variants, /ceo-review, etc.)
  - Persona routes (/persona/current, /persona/switch, /mode/trace)
  - Debug routes (/api/debug/*)
  - Memory operations (/memory/read, /memory/write, /memory/delete)

The merged solution successfully combines the best elements of both versions while ensuring all requirements are met for backend-only deployment to Railway.
