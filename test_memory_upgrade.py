Test Script for Memory Upgrade Patch

This script tests the implementation of the Memory Upgrade Patch for Orchestrator Integration.
It verifies:
1. The StepType enum with expanded step types
2. The ThreadRequest schema for batched thread writing
3. The updated /memory/thread route
4. The patched /memory/summarize endpoint with fallback agent_id
