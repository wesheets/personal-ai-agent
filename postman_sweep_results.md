# Postman Sweep Test Results

## Test Environment
- Local: http://localhost:8000
- Production: https://web-production-2639.up.railway.app

## Endpoints to Test

| Module | Endpoint | Method | Local Status | Production Status |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Delegate | `/api/delegate` | POST | ❌ Connection Error | ❌ 404 Not Found |
| Memory Read | `/api/memory/read?agent_id=hal` | GET | ❌ Connection Error | ✅ 200 OK |
| Memory Write | `/api/memory/write` | POST | ❌ Connection Error | ✅ 200 OK |
| Memory Summarize | `/api/memory/summarize` | POST | ❌ Connection Error | ✅ 200 OK |
| Memory Thread | `/api/memory/thread` | GET | ❌ Connection Error | ✅ 200 OK |
| System Status | `/api/system/status` | GET | ❌ Connection Error | ❌ 404 Not Found |
| Agent List | `/api/agent/list` | GET | ❌ Connection Error | ❌ 404 Not Found |
| Orchestrator Instruction | `/api/orchestrator/consult` | POST | ❌ Connection Error | ❌ 404 Not Found |

## Failures and Issues
1. **Delegate Endpoint** - 404 Not Found in production
   - The `/api/delegate` endpoint is not registered or accessible
   - This is a critical route for task delegation

2. **System Status Endpoint** - 404 Not Found in production
   - The `/api/system/status` endpoint is not registered or accessible
   - This endpoint is needed for monitoring system health

3. **Agent List Endpoint** - 404 Not Found in production
   - The `/api/agent/list` endpoint is not registered or accessible
   - This endpoint is required for agent discovery

4. **Orchestrator Instruction Endpoint** - 404 Not Found in production
   - The `/api/orchestrator/consult` endpoint is not registered or accessible
   - This is a critical route for HAL's instruction loop and Phase 11 cognition testing
   - This was the primary focus of our previous implementation task

5. **Memory Thread Method** - Requires GET instead of POST
   - The `/api/memory/thread` endpoint requires GET method with query parameters
   - Documentation should be updated to reflect this

## Debug Tracker Results
The `run_debug_sequence.py` script was executed and properly logged all test attempts to the `debug_tracker.md` file. The script confirmed:

1. All local endpoints return connection errors (expected since local server is not running)
2. The debug logging system is functioning correctly
3. The script attempts to test all required endpoints including the new `/api/orchestrator/consult` route

This validates that our debug tracking system from the previous task is working as expected.
