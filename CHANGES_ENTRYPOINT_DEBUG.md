# Production Entrypoint Debug Patch Implementation

## Changes Implemented

This update adds diagnostic endpoints and logging to confirm whether FastAPI is actually executing route logic in production or if there's a deployment-level execution block (ASGI, port, worker config, etc.).

### Startup Log Validation

Added a clear startup log message to confirm when the FastAPI app object is successfully created:

```python
print("ðŸ”“ FastAPI app object was successfully created in main.py")
```

This log appears immediately after the FastAPI app initialization, providing confirmation that the app object is being created correctly.

### Simple GET Echo Route

Added a simple GET echo route directly in main.py to test basic route execution:

```python
@app.get("/echo")
async def echo():
    print("ðŸ“¡ /echo route was hit!")
    return {
        "status": "ok",
        "message": "Echo is working"
    }
```

This route is intentionally simple and uses a GET method (instead of POST) to eliminate potential issues with request body parsing or complex logic. When hit, it will log a clear message and return a simple JSON response.

### Environment Dump Endpoint

Added an environment dump endpoint to provide diagnostic information about the runtime environment:

```python
import os
@app.get("/env")
async def env_dump():
    return {
        "cwd": os.getcwd(),
        "env": dict(os.environ)
    }
```

This endpoint returns the current working directory and environment variables, which can help diagnose deployment-level issues.

### Purpose

These changes help diagnose whether FastAPI is actually executing route logic in production by:

1. Confirming the FastAPI app object is created successfully
2. Providing a simple GET route that should work regardless of request body parsing issues
3. Exposing environment information to identify potential deployment configuration problems

### Testing Results

The implementation was tested by importing the main application module, which triggers the startup sequence. The test output confirmed that the application starts up correctly with the new startup log validation message appearing in the logs.

When the `/echo` route is hit in production, we expect to see the "ðŸ“¡ /echo route was hit!" log message and receive a 200 response with the success message, confirming that FastAPI is executing route handlers correctly.
