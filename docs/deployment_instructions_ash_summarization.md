# Deployment Instructions for ASH Summarization Fix

## Overview

This document provides instructions for deploying the fix for ASH's summarization logic. The fix ensures that ASH properly consumes HAL's output, summarizes it, and returns both `summary.task.output` and `reflection` fields in its output.

## Changes Made

1. Modified `app/modules/instruction_validator.py` to:
   - Add a specific case for ASH in the `extract_outputs_from_memory` function
   - Ensure ASH returns the required `summary.task.output` field
   - Ensure ASH returns the required `reflection` field
   - Update HAL's mock output to match the test case

2. Added `tests/test_hal_to_ash_chain.py` to:
   - Verify that HAL's output is correctly formatted
   - Verify that ASH properly consumes HAL's output
   - Verify that ASH returns the required fields
   - Validate the content matches the expected format

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Create and Merge Pull Request

1. Visit the GitHub repository and create a pull request for the `feature/fix-ash-summarization` branch:
   https://github.com/wesheets/personal-ai-agent/pull/new/feature/fix-ash-summarization

2. Review the changes to ensure they match the expected modifications:
   - `app/modules/instruction_validator.py`
   - `tests/test_hal_to_ash_chain.py`

3. Merge the pull request into the main branch

### 2. Deploy to Railway

1. Log in to Railway and navigate to your project dashboard

2. Verify that Railway is set up to automatically deploy from the main branch
   - If not, manually trigger a deployment after the PR is merged

3. Monitor the deployment logs for any errors
   - Pay special attention to any import or syntax errors

### 3. Verify the Fix

1. After deployment is complete, test the `/api/project/start` endpoint with a sample goal:
   ```json
   {
     "goal": "Write a Python function that capitalizes each word in a string"
   }
   ```

2. Verify that the chain executes successfully without the "Missing outputs: ['task.output']" error

3. Check the response to ensure it contains:
   - HAL's implementation of the capitalize_words function
   - ASH's summary of HAL's implementation
   - ASH's reflection on HAL's implementation

### 4. Troubleshooting

If issues persist after deployment:

1. Check the Railway logs for any errors related to the modified files

2. Run the test script locally to verify the fix works in the development environment:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   python3 tests/test_hal_to_ash_chain.py
   ```

3. If needed, make additional adjustments to the implementation and repeat the deployment process

## Rollback Plan

If the deployment causes unexpected issues:

1. Revert the merge commit in GitHub
2. Trigger a new deployment in Railway
3. Verify that the system returns to its previous state
