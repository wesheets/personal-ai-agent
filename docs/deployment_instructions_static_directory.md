# Deployment Instructions for Static Directory Fix

## Overview

This document provides instructions for deploying the fix for the missing `/app/static` directory that was causing the Railway deployment to crash with the error: `RuntimeError: Directory 'app/static' does not exist`.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Create and Merge Pull Request

```bash
# The branch has already been pushed to GitHub
# Create a pull request from the feature/fix-static-folder-crash branch to the main branch
```

Visit: https://github.com/wesheets/personal-ai-agent/pull/new/feature/fix-static-folder-crash

After code review, merge the pull request into the main branch.

### 2. Deploy to Railway

Once the pull request is merged, deploy the updated code to Railway:

1. Log in to your Railway dashboard
2. Select the Promethios project
3. Navigate to the Deployments tab
4. Click "Deploy" to deploy the latest code from the main branch
5. Wait for the deployment to complete (usually takes 2-3 minutes)

### 3. Verify the Deployment

After deployment, verify that the static directory is properly mounted and the deployment is successful:

1. Check the Railway deployment logs for successful static files mounting:
   ```
   ✅ FastAPI app initialized
   ✅ StaticFiles mounted at /static
   ✅ Container is healthy
   ```

2. Verify that the `/api/project/start` route is now accessible:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/project/start \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"goal": "Write a Python function that reverses a string"}'
   ```

   This should return a successful response with project_id, chain_id, and agent results.

3. Check the Railway dashboard to confirm the deployment status is "Healthy"

## Implemented Fix

The following fix has been implemented to resolve the deployment crash:

1. **Created Static Directory**
   - Added the missing `/app/static` directory that FastAPI needs to mount at startup
   - This resolves the `RuntimeError: Directory 'app/static' does not exist` error

2. **Added .gitkeep File**
   - Added a `.gitkeep` file to ensure Git tracks the empty directory
   - This ensures the directory is included in the deployment

## Future Considerations

Now that the static directory is properly set up, you can use it to serve static files such as:

- CSS stylesheets
- JavaScript files
- Images
- Fonts
- Other static assets

To serve a static file, place it in the `/app/static` directory and access it via the `/static` URL path.

## Troubleshooting

If the deployment is still failing after applying this fix, check the following:

1. **Verify the Directory Structure**
   - Ensure the `/app/static` directory exists in the repository
   - Confirm the `.gitkeep` file is present in the directory

2. **Check Railway Logs**
   - Look for any errors in the Railway logs related to static files mounting
   - Verify that the FastAPI app is properly initialized

3. **Restart the Deployment**
   - Sometimes a simple restart can resolve issues
   - In the Railway dashboard, select the Promethios project and click "Restart"
