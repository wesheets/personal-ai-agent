# Orchestrator Scope Module

## Overview

The Orchestrator Scope module provides a strategic project planning capability that turns high-level user goals into structured system plans. It outputs a full project scaffold including modules, agents, schema, risks, and test payloads ready for execution or simulation.

## Endpoint

```

## Implementation Details

### Module Analysis

The Orchestrator Scope module analyzes the user's goal to determine which modules are required for the project. It looks for keywords in the goal text to identify relevant modules:

- Base modules (always included): write, read, reflect
- Summarization: summarize (keywords: summarize, summary, summarization)
- Task management: task/status (keywords: task, status, progress, track)
- Training: train (keywords: train, learning, teach)
- Delegation: delegate (keywords: delegate, assign, handoff)
- Looping: loop (keywords: loop, iterate, cycle)

### Agent Selection

The module suggests appropriate agents based on the goal and required modules:

- HAL: Analytical and reflective tasks, good for summarization
- ASH: Action-oriented tasks, good for delegation and execution

### Schema Generation

The module generates recommended input and output schemas based on the required modules:

- Base input fields: agent_id, goal, project_id
- Additional input fields: memory_trace_id (if reflection or summarization is needed)
- Base output fields: status, result
- Additional output fields: summary (if summarization is needed)

### Memory Storage

If the `store_scope` parameter is set to `true`, the module stores the generated scope in memory with:

- agent_id: "system"
- type: "project_scope"
- tags: ["project_scope", f"project:{project_id}"]
- project_id: The project ID
- status: "active"
- task_type: "scope"

## Error Handling

The endpoint returns appropriate error responses in the following cases:

- 422 Unprocessable Entity: Missing required fields (e.g., goal)
- 500 Internal Server Error: Error during scope generation

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation uses static logic to generate project scopes. Future enhancements could include:

- Agent-powered generation for more dynamic and context-aware scopes
- Support for "simulate" mode to simulate project execution
- Support for "build" mode to automatically build the project scaffold
- Integration with other orchestration components for end-to-end project execution

## Testing

The module includes comprehensive tests in `/tests/test_orchestrator_scope.py` that verify:

- Basic functionality
- Project ID handling
- Memory storage
- Required fields validation
- Module analysis
- Agent selection
- Markdown summary generation
- Suggested tests generation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.example.com/orchestrator/scope",
    json={
        "goal": "Create a journaling application with reflection capabilities"
    }
)

scope = response.json()
print(f"Project ID: {scope['project_id']}")
print(f"Required modules: {scope['required_modules']}")
```

### With Project ID and Storage

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.example.com/orchestrator/scope",
    json={
        "goal": "Build a task management system with delegation",
        "project_id": "proj-task-manager",
        "store_scope": true
    }
)

scope = response.json()
print(f"Project ID: {scope['project_id']}")
print(f"Stored: {scope['stored']}")
```

### Using the Markdown Summary

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.example.com/orchestrator/scope",
    json={
        "goal": "Create a data analysis pipeline with visualization"
    }
)

scope = response.json()
markdown = scope["markdown_summary"]

# Save the markdown to a file
with open("project_scope.md", "w") as f:
    f.write(markdown)
```
