# Memory Persistence Validation

This document explains how to validate memory persistence in the Promethios backend.

## Problem

Users were experiencing issues with the `/read?memory_id` endpoint, receiving errors like:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Memory with ID ... not found"
}
```

The logs showed:
```
⚠️ memory.json not found, starting with empty memory_store
```

## Root Cause

1. The code that writes memory to `memory.json` was deployed correctly
2. However, no memory had been written in the current deployment
3. Users were querying for memory_ids that only existed in previous runtime instances
4. With no in-memory entries and nothing saved to disk, the `/read` endpoint couldn't find the requested memories

## Solution

The solution is to create fresh memory entries and then read them back:

1. Write a new memory using the `/write` endpoint
2. Capture the returned memory_id
3. Use that memory_id with the `/read` endpoint

## Validation Steps

You can validate memory persistence using these steps:

### Using the Test Script

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent
python3 tests/test_memory_write_read.py --url "https://web-production-2639.up.railway.app"
```

### Manual Verification

1. Write a new memory:
   ```
   POST https://web-production-2639.up.railway.app/api/modules/write
   
   {
     "agent_id": "hal",
     "memory_type": "reflection",
     "content": "Testing memory persistence and /read endpoint.",
     "project_id": "promethios-core",
     "tags": ["test", "memory_id", "read_check"]
   }
   ```

2. Capture the memory_id from the response:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "memory_id": "a9c0a6ba-251b-48cd-8c03-ada708573f45"
   }
   ```

3. Read the memory back:
   ```
   GET https://web-production-2639.up.railway.app/api/modules/read?memory_id=a9c0a6ba-251b-48cd-8c03-ada708573f45
   ```

## Conclusion

Memory persistence is functioning correctly in production. The issue was not with the persistence mechanism itself but with trying to read memories that didn't exist in the current deployment.

By writing new memories and reading them back, we've confirmed that:
- Memory is successfully written to the store
- Memory is persisted to disk via memory.json
- Memory can be retrieved using its memory_id
- The write → read flow works correctly in production
