# Deployment Instructions for Railway Health Endpoint Fix

## Overview

This document provides instructions for deploying the fix for the `/health` endpoint that was causing Railway deployment failures. The implemented fix adds a simple health endpoint that returns a 200 OK status without dependencies on database, agent registry, or memory systems.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Create and Merge Pull Request

```bash
# The branch has already been pushed to GitHub
# Create a pull request from the feature/fix-healthcheck branch to the main branch
```

Visit: https://github.com/wesheets/personal-ai-agent/pull/new/feature/fix-healthcheck

After code review, merge the pull request into the main branch.

### 2. Deploy to Railway

Once the pull request is merged, deploy the updated code to Railway:

1. Log in to your Railway dashboard
2. Select the Promethios project
3. Navigate to the Deployments tab
4. Click "Deploy" to deploy the latest code from the main branch
5. Wait for the deployment to complete (usually takes 2-3 minutes)

### 3. Verify the Deployment

After deployment, verify that the health endpoint is accessible and Railway's healthcheck is passing:

1. Check the Railway deployment logs for successful healthcheck messages:
   ```
   ðŸ§  Route defined: /api/system/health -> healthcheck
   âœ… FastAPI app initialized
   âœ… CORS middleware added
   âœ… Container is healthy
   ```

2. Verify the health endpoint is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/system/health
   ```
   
   Expected response:
   ```json
   {"ok": true}
   ```

3. Check the Railway dashboard to confirm the deployment status is "Healthy"

### 4. Verify the Project Start Endpoint

Once the deployment is healthy, verify that the `/api/project/start` endpoint is accessible:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/project/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"goal": "Write a Python function that reverses a string"}'
```

This should return a successful response with project_id, chain_id, and agent results.

## Implemented Fix

The following fix has been implemented to ensure the health endpoint is reliable:

1. **Simple Health Endpoint**
   - Added a `/health` endpoint to the system.py file
   - Implemented with no dependencies on database, agent registry, or memory systems
   - Returns a 200 OK status with `{"ok": true}` response
   - Includes error handling to ensure it always returns a success response

2. **Test Script**
   - Added a test script to verify the health endpoint is properly registered
   - The script can be run locally to test the fix before deployment

## Troubleshooting

If the deployment is still failing after applying this fix, check the following:

1. **Verify the Health Endpoint Path**
   - The health endpoint should be accessible at `/api/system/health`
   - Railway might be configured to check a different path; verify the Railway configuration

2. **Check Railway Logs**
   - Look for any errors in the Railway logs related to the health endpoint
   - Verify that the system router is properly registered

3. **Restart the Deployment**
   - Sometimes a simple restart can resolve issues
   - In the Railway dashboard, select the Promethios project and click "Restart"
