# Memory DB Path Logging Fix

## Problem
The memory persistence issue between `/memory/write` and `/memory/thread` endpoints was partially resolved, but a new error appeared:

```json
"status": "error",
"message": "'MemoryDB' object has no attribute 'DB_FILE'"
```

This error occurred because the code was trying to access `DB_FILE` as an attribute of the `MemoryDB` class, but it was defined at the module level in memory_db.py.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Path Accessor to MemoryDB Class
- Added `db_path` as an instance attribute in the `MemoryDB` class
- Implemented a `get_path()` method to retrieve the absolute path to the database file

```python
def __init__(self):
    if self._initialized:
        return
        
    # Create database directory if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(DB_DIR):
        os.makedirs(DB_DIR)
        
    # Store the database path as an instance attribute
    self.db_path = DB_FILE
    
    # Initialize database
    self._init_db()
    
    # Set initialized flag
    self._initialized = True
    
    # Log initialization with absolute path
    logger.info(f"âœ… MemoryDB initialized with database file: {os.path.abspath(self.db_path)}")
    print(f"ðŸ§  [INIT] MemoryDB initialized with database file: {os.path.abspath(self.db_path)}")

def get_path(self):
    """
    Get the absolute path to the database file.
    
    Returns:
        str: Absolute path to the database file
    """
    return os.path.abspath(self.db_path)
```

### 2. Updated All References in memory.py
- Changed all instances of `memory_db.DB_FILE` to `memory_db.get_path()`
- Fixed references in:
  - `initialize_memory_store()` function
  - `write_memory()` function
  - `memory_read_endpoint()` function
  - `memory_thread()` function

### 3. Verified Implementation
- Tested the implementation with a simple Python script
- Confirmed that `memory_db.get_path()` correctly returns the absolute path to the database file
- Verified that the path is properly logged during database operations

## Testing Results
```
ðŸ’¾ [DB] Absolute database path: /home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/db/memory.db
ðŸ§  [DB] New database connection created in thread 139871887737280
ðŸ§  [INIT] Database initialized with schema from /home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/db/memory_schema.sql
ðŸ§  [INIT] MemoryDB initialized with database file: /home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/db/memory.db
DB Path: /home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/db/memory.db
```

## Deployment
The changes have been committed and pushed to the main branch with the message:
```
fix: resolve DB_FILE logging error and verify absolute path usage across endpoints
```

## Expected Results
With this fix, both the `/memory/write` and `/memory/thread` endpoints should now:
1. Correctly log the absolute database path
2. Use the same database file for operations
3. No longer encounter the "'MemoryDB' object has no attribute 'DB_FILE'" error

The memory persistence verification implemented in the previous commit will also work correctly, confirming that memories are properly persisted to the database and immediately retrievable.
