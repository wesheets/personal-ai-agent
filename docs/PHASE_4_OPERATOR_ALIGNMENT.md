# Phase 4 Operator Alignment Summary

**Date:** Fri May 02 2025 19:28:39 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
**Task:** Reconcile architectural plan with live repository structure prior to Phase 4.1.

## Process Overview

This reconciliation task was performed by a clean instance of Manus, focusing solely on structural verification without cognitive processing or file mutation.

1.  **Input Plan:** The architectural plan provided in ``promethios_file_tree_plan.v2.8_candidate.json` was loaded by Reconciler Manus` was read and parsed.
2.  **Live Repository Scan:** The `personal-ai-agent` repository was cloned, and its file structure was scanned to create a live inventory (``live_repo_files.txt` (generated inventory of repository state)`).
3.  **Reconciliation:** A Python script (``reconcile.py` (executed by Reconciler Manus)`) was executed to compare the planned file structure against the live inventory. This identified files that were present, missing, extra, or potentially stubbed compared to the plan.
4.  **Output Generation:** Based on the reconciliation results and direct repository scans, the following output files were generated:
    *   `reconciled_file_tree.json`: Reflects the actual files found in the repository, annotated with purpose/type where available from the plan.
    *   `drift_log.json`: Documents discrepancies between the planned and actual file structures (missing, extra, stubbed files).
    *   `toolkit_registry.py`: Lists Python modules found in the `/tools` directory of the live repository.

## Key Findings & Issues

*   **Reconciliation Successful:** The core reconciliation process completed successfully, generating the `reconciled_file_tree.json` and `drift_log.json` files.
*   **Toolkit Registry Generated:** The `toolkit_registry.py` was generated based on a direct scan of the `/tools` directory.
*   **Agent Registry Generation Failed:** The optional generation of `agent_registry.json` failed. The script (``generate_agent_registry.py` (sandbox utility script)`) encountered errors while attempting to parse the `AGENT_REGISTRY` dictionary from `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/registries/agent_registry.py`. The error message indicated `'{' was never closed`, suggesting complex syntax (potentially multi-line strings, comments, or other constructs) that `ast.literal_eval` could not handle safely. As this output was optional, generation was skipped.
*   **Drift Detected:** The `drift_log.json` file contains details of files that were planned but missing, files found that were not in the plan, and files potentially marked as stubbed. Reviewing this log is crucial for understanding the current state versus the intended architecture.

## Conclusion

The structural reconciliation is complete. The generated files provide a truth-based view of the repository's structure relative to the plan, highlighting areas of drift. These outputs are intended for use in Phase 4.1 to ensure cognition begins from an accurate structural baseline.

## Phase 2 Reconciliation (Runtime Alignment)

**Date:** 2025-05-02T19:36:26.366217Z
**Task:** Resolve drift identified in Phase 1 and finalize truth state.

### Process Overview

1.  **Input Analysis:** The `drift_log.json` from Phase 1 was cross-referenced with the original architectural plan (`promethios_file_tree_plan.v2.8_candidate.json`) and the reconciled live structure (`reconciled_file_tree.json`).
2.  **Runtime Plan Generation:** A new plan, `promethios_file_tree_plan.v2.9_runtime_aligned.json`, was generated. This plan updates the status of each file based on whether it was found, missing, or stubbed in the live repository during Phase 1 reconciliation. Files found in the repo but not in the original plan were added.
3.  **Drift Resolution Summary:** A detailed log, `drift_resolution_summary.md`, was created documenting how each item from the original plan and any extra files were handled in the v2.9 plan.
4.  **Alignment Confirmation:**
    *   **`reconciled_file_tree.json` vs. `v2.9 Plan`:** The `promethios_file_tree_plan.v2.9_runtime_aligned.json` was generated directly from the reconciled tree and original plan. By definition, it reflects the structure found in `reconciled_file_tree.json`.
    *   **`agent_registry.py` vs. `v2.9 Plan`:** Agent file existence check passed: All agent files listed in `promethios_file_tree_plan.v2.9_runtime_aligned.json` with status 'found_in_repo' or 'stubbed_in_repo' exist in the repository, and those marked 'missing_from_repo' do not.

*Note: Direct parsing of `agent_registry.py` to confirm agent definitions failed in Phase 1 due to syntax complexity and was not re-attempted. This check relies on file existence as listed in the v2.9 plan.*

### Conclusion (Phase 2)

Phase 2 reconciliation is complete. The `promethios_file_tree_plan.v2.9_runtime_aligned.json` represents the finalized, runtime-aligned architectural truth state based on the live repository structure. The `drift_resolution_summary.md` details the reconciliation steps taken.

## Phase 4.1 Canonical Update â€“ Plan v3.0 Finalization

`promethios_file_tree_plan.v3.0_canonical.json` now includes:

- All reconciled files from runtime-aligned v2.9
- Operator-injected governance surfaces from v2.9.2
- New runtime tracking layer: `logs/drift_surface_report.json`

This file becomes the trusted foundation for executor validation and agent cognition post-Batch 15. It fully reflects current architectural memory and injected belief structure.
