# Agent Registry Compliance Status Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the agent registry compliance status for the Promethios Cognitive OS. The analysis identified 21 agents across the system, with significant compliance gaps in SDK integration, schema validation, and agent registration. Key findings include:

- **0 of 21 agents** currently use the standardized Agent SDK
- **Only 4 of 21 agents** have schema definitions, with only 2 implementing partial validation
- **8 agents** are not properly registered in the agent registry system
- **2 critical priority agents** (memory-agent and orchestrator-agent) lack schema validation

This report includes detailed compliance analysis, refactored agent templates, and implementation recommendations to address these issues.

## Compliance Status Overview

| Metric | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Total Agents | 21 | Identified across all repository directories |
| Agents with SDK Integration | 0 (0%) | No agents currently use the standardized SDK |
| Agents with Schema Validation | 4 (19%) | Only cto-agent, debugger-agent, historian-agent, and pessimist-agent have schemas |
| Properly Registered Agents | 13 (62%) | 8 agents are not registered in any registry file |
| Critical Priority Issues | 6 | 2 critical agents without schemas, 4 critical validation gaps |

## Implementation Progress

The following components have been implemented to address compliance issues:

1. **Agent SDK Module** - A standardized interface for creating and registering agents with proper schema validation and memory integration.

2. **Agent Integration Templates** - Example implementations showing how to refactor existing agents:
   - CTO Agent SDK Template
   - Memory Agent SDK Integration

3. **Schema Definitions** - New schema definitions for critical agents:
   - Memory Agent Output Schema

4. **Memory Write Validation** - A wrapper system to ensure all memory writes are validated against schemas before execution.

5. **Comprehensive Agent Manifest** - An updated agent manifest with compliance flags for all agents.

## Critical Issues and Recommendations

### 1. Memory Agent Schema Validation

**Issue**: The memory agent writes directly to the system memory without schema validation, risking data corruption.

**Recommendation**: Implement the provided Memory Agent SDK Integration and schema validation wrapper to ensure all memory operations are validated before execution.

### 2. Orchestrator Agent Schema Validation

**Issue**: The orchestrator coordinates all other agents without validated contracts, risking system-wide failures.

**Recommendation**: Create an orchestrator output schema and implement SDK integration for the orchestrator agent with strict validation.

### 3. Safety Monitoring Validation

**Issue**: The HAL agent performs safety monitoring without schema validation, risking unreliable constraint enforcement.

**Recommendation**: Create a HAL output schema and implement SDK integration with validation for all safety assessments.

### 4. Unregistered Agents

**Issue**: 8 agents are implemented but not registered in the agent registry system, making them invisible to the orchestration system.

**Recommendation**: Register all agents using the provided registration code in the agent registry file.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure (Immediate)

1. Implement Memory Agent SDK Integration and schema validation
2. Implement Orchestrator Agent SDK Integration and schema
3. Create and implement HAL Agent schema validation

### Phase 2: Core Agents (1-2 weeks)

1. Implement SDK integration for core-forge, ash-agent, and ops-agent
2. Create schemas for all core agents
3. Register all unregistered core agents

### Phase 3: Supporting Agents (2-4 weeks)

1. Implement SDK integration for remaining agents
2. Create schemas for all supporting agents
3. Register all remaining unregistered agents

## Conclusion

The Promethios Cognitive OS requires significant work to achieve full agent registry compliance. The most critical issues involve the memory and orchestrator agents, which should be addressed immediately to ensure system stability and data integrity. The provided SDK, templates, and schemas provide a clear path to full compliance, with a phased implementation approach recommended to minimize disruption.

All deliverables, including the Agent SDK, integration templates, schemas, and validation wrappers, are included in the agent_compliance directory and ready for implementation.
