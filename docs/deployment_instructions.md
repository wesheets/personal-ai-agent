# Deployment Instructions for Fixing 404 Error on `/api/project/start` Endpoint

## Overview

This document provides instructions for deploying the fix for the 404 error on the `/api/project/start` endpoint. Our investigation has confirmed that the router registration is correctly implemented in the codebase, but the endpoint may still be returning a 404 error due to deployment issues.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push the Feature Branch to GitHub

```bash
git push origin feature/fix-project-start-route
```

### 2. Create a Pull Request

Create a pull request from the `feature/fix-project-start-route` branch to the main branch.

### 3. Deploy to Railway

Once the pull request is merged, deploy the updated code to Railway:

1. Log in to your Railway dashboard
2. Select the Promethios project
3. Navigate to the Deployments tab
4. Click "Deploy" to deploy the latest code from the main branch
5. Wait for the deployment to complete (usually takes 2-3 minutes)

### 4. Verify the Deployment

After deployment, verify that the endpoint is accessible:

1. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   python tests/test_project_start.py
   ```

2. Or use curl to test the endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/project/start \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"goal": "Create a simple hello world program"}'
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If the endpoint is still returning a 404 error after deployment, try the following:

### 1. Check Railway Logs

1. Go to the Railway dashboard
2. Select the Promethios project
3. Navigate to the Logs tab
4. Look for any errors related to the `/api/project/start` endpoint

### 2. Verify Route Registration

Check if the route is properly registered by examining the startup logs:

1. In the Railway dashboard, look for logs containing "ROUTES REGISTERED ON STARTUP"
2. Verify that `/api/project/start` is listed among the registered routes

### 3. Restart the Application

Sometimes a simple restart can resolve routing issues:

1. In the Railway dashboard, select the Promethios project
2. Navigate to the Settings tab
3. Click "Restart" to restart the application

### 4. Check HTTP Method

Ensure you're using the correct HTTP method (POST) when accessing the endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/project/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"goal": "Create a simple hello world program"}'
```
