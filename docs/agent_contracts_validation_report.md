# Agent Contracts Validation Report

## Summary
I've examined the `agent_contracts.json` file for the reported JSON syntax error at line 7, column 29 (char 268). The file is valid and properly formatted.

## Findings
- The file exists at `/home/ubuntu/personal-ai-agent/app/contracts/agent_contracts.json`
- JSON validation was successful with no syntax errors
- The character at position 268 is a double quote (") followed by "outp" (part of "output_must_be_wrapped")
- Successfully loaded 5 agent contracts: critic, forge, hal, orchestrator, and sage
- All boolean values are properly formatted as lowercase JSON booleans (`true`/`false`)
- No trailing commas, empty fields, or comments were found

## Possible Explanations
1. The error was fixed in a previous task (we did fix JSON boolean values in the previous task)
2. The error description in the task was incorrect or outdated
3. The error might have been in a different file or at a different location

## Verification
- JSON validation successful
- Loaded agent contracts: 5 agents
- Agent IDs: critic, forge, hal, orchestrator, sage

## Memory Tag
`agent_contracts_patch_final_20250425`

## Next Steps
The Promethios backend should now boot cleanly without the JSON parsing error. The system is ready for:
1. Activating the Skeptic Suite
2. Running full loops
3. Verifying backend routes: `/health`, `/forge/build`, `/loop/validate`
