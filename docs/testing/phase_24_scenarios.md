# Phase 24 Scenarios

This document outlines the scenarios for Phase 24: Self-Opposition, Complexity Audit & Justification Enhancements.

## Scenario 1: High Uncertainty Mutation Block
- **Description**: Agent attempts a high-impact mutation with a high uncertainty score.
- **Expected Behavior**: Mutation guard reflex (Batch 24.0) should block the mutation.
- **Log Evidence**: `mutation_guard.log` should show a blocked mutation due to uncertainty.

## Scenario 2: Emergency Reflection Mode Block
- **Description**: Agent is in Emergency Reflection Mode and attempts a mutation.
- **Expected Behavior**: Mutation guard reflex (Batch 24.0) should block the mutation.
- **Log Evidence**: `mutation_guard.log` should show a blocked mutation due to Emergency Reflection Mode.

## Scenario 3: Loop Shaping by Reflex
- **Description**: A reflex (e.g., anomaly detection) triggers during a loop, suggesting a change in intent.
- **Expected Behavior**: Loop shaping mechanism (Batch 24.1) should modify the loop intent or parameters.
- **Log Evidence**: `reflex_trigger_log.json` and/or `loop_shaping_log.json` should show the shaping action.

## Scenario 4: Self-Opposition Halts Loop
- **Description**: A loop summary is generated that conflicts with the agent's core directives or recent high-priority goals.
- **Expected Behavior**: Self-opposition check (Batch 24.2) should halt the loop before mutation.
- **Log Evidence**: `loop_summary_rejection_log.json` should show a loop halted by self-opposition.
