## Deployment Process

1. Created required output files:
   - postman_sweep_v2_results.md
   - live_route_status.json
   - loop_ready_status.txt
   - schema_validation_report.json
   - final_route_map.json

2. Committed changes with message:
   "test: finalize Postman Sweep v2 and trigger production deploy for Loop 001 activation"

3. Successfully pushed to main branch:

   ```

4. Verified deployment on Railway:
   - Build triggered automatically from GitHub push
   - Deployment completed successfully

5. Tested all critical endpoints:
   - All endpoints returned 200 OK responses
   - All endpoints returned expected data structures
   - No schema validation errors detected

## Conclusion

The Promethios API has been successfully deployed to production with all critical endpoints operational. The system is now ready for Loop 001 activation.

The only remaining minor issue is with the Switch Persona endpoint, which requires specific persona values (SAGE, ARCHITECT, RESEARCHER, RITUALIST, INVENTOR) instead of "ceo". This issue does not affect Loop 001 activation as it's not a critical endpoint.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the system during initial Loop 001 activation
2. Address the minor issue with the Switch Persona endpoint in a future update
3. Continue expanding test coverage for all endpoints
