# Missing Agents Restoration Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to restore the missing agent modules required for AGENT_RUNNERS functionality.

## Problem

The AGENT_RUNNERS dictionary was failing to load due to missing agent modules:
```
‚ùå Failed to load AGENT_RUNNERS: No module named 'app.agents.critic'
‚ùå Failed to load AGENT_RUNNERS: No module named 'app.agents.sage'
‚ùå Failed to load AGENT_RUNNERS: No module named 'app.agents.orchestrator'
```

This prevented the cognitive agent loop from functioning properly.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Created CRITIC Agent Placeholder

Created a new `app/agents/critic.py` file with the placeholder implementation:

```python
def run_critic_agent(task: str, project_id: str, tools: list = None):
    print(f"üü® CRITIC agent placeholder running task '{task}' on project '{project_id}'")
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "output": f"CRITIC agent placeholder executed task '{task}'"
    }
```

### 2. Created SAGE Agent Placeholder

Created a new `app/agents/sage.py` file with the placeholder implementation:

```python
def run_sage_agent(task: str, project_id: str, tools: list = None):
    print(f"üü© SAGE agent placeholder running task '{task}' on project '{project_id}'")
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "output": f"SAGE agent placeholder executed task '{task}'"
    }
```

### 3. Created ORCHESTRATOR Agent Placeholder

During testing, we discovered that an additional module was needed. Created a new `app/agents/orchestrator.py` file with the placeholder implementation:

```python
def run_orchestrator_agent(task: str, project_id: str, tools: list = None):
    print(f"üü™ ORCHESTRATOR agent placeholder running task '{task}' on project '{project_id}'")
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "output": f"ORCHESTRATOR agent placeholder executed task '{task}'"
    }
```

### 4. Verified AGENT_RUNNERS Dictionary

Confirmed that `agent_runner.py` correctly imports all agent modules and initializes the AGENT_RUNNERS dictionary:

```python
try:
    from app.agents.hal import run_hal_agent
    from app.agents.nova import run_nova_agent
    from app.agents.ash import run_ash_agent
    from app.agents.critic import run_critic_agent
    from app.agents.orchestrator import run_orchestrator_agent
    from app.agents.sage import run_sage_agent

    AGENT_RUNNERS = {
        "hal": run_hal_agent,
        "nova": run_nova_agent,
        "ash": run_ash_agent,
        "critic": run_critic_agent,
        "orchestrator": run_orchestrator_agent,
        "sage": run_sage_agent
    }
    print(f"‚úÖ AGENT_RUNNERS initialized with: {list(AGENT_RUNNERS.keys())}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ùå Failed to load AGENT_RUNNERS: {e}")
    AGENT_RUNNERS = {}
```

## Testing Results

Local testing confirmed that AGENT_RUNNERS now loads successfully with all six required agents:

```
‚úÖ AGENT_RUNNERS initialized with: ['hal', 'nova', 'ash', 'critic', 'orchestrator', 'sage']
Available agents: ['hal', 'nova', 'ash', 'critic', 'orchestrator', 'sage']
```

## Expected Outcome in Production

In production, the AGENT_RUNNERS dictionary should be initialized with all six agents, allowing the complete cognitive agent loop to function properly.

## Next Steps

Once deployed to production, we should test:

1. Agent execution for each agent type:
```bash
curl -X POST https://web-production-2639.up.railway.app/api/agent/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "critic", "project_id": "demo_001", "task": "Review project"}'
```

2. Complete cognition chain:
   - POST `/api/project/start`
   - GET `/api/system/status?project_id=demo_001`
   - POST `/api/agent/run`
   - POST `/api/system/summary`

This should verify that the full Playground ‚Üí Agent Autonomy flow is working correctly.
