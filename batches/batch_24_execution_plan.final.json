Add checks for active reflex flags related to the current context (e.g., check `uncertainty_escalation_log.json` for recent unresolved high uncertainty for the target component/agent, check `reflex_trigger_log.json` for active Emergency Reflection Mode). If relevant risk flags are active, reject the mutation and log the reason (e.g., \"Mutation blocked due to active high-uncertainty flag\").\n3. **Integration & Test (Uncertainty Block):** Run a loop (`loop_0030a`) designed to trigger high uncertainty escalation (like 23.2) but where Operator hypothetically approves. Verify `mutation_guard.py` still blocks the mutation due to the active uncertainty flag.\n4. **Integration & Test (Emergency Mode Block):** Simulate Emergency Reflection Mode being active. Run a loop (`loop_0030b`) attempting mutation. Verify `mutation_guard.py` blocks it.\n5. **Functional Validation:** Check `mutation_guard.log` confirms rejection occurred specifically due to active reflex flags in both test cases.

When a reflex is triggered (e.g., archetype saturation detected by `archetype_feedback_loop.py`), modify the *intent* for the *next* planned loop (or generate a specific corrective loop intent). Example: If Optimize archetype saturated, force next loop intent to Analyze or Validate related components. Log the shaping action (original intent, trigger, new intent) to `reflex_trigger_log.json` or a dedicated `loop_shaping_log.json`.\n3. **Integration & Test:** Run a sequence: Loop `loop_0031a` creates archetype saturation. Run `loop_0031b` (next loop). Verify controller detects saturation from `loop_0031a` history, logs shaping action, and `loop_0031b` executes with a modified intent (e.g., Analyze instead of Optimize).\n4. **Functional Validation:** Check logs (`reflex_trigger_log.json` or `loop_shaping_log.json`) confirm shaping action was logged.

Before calling `mutation_guard.py`, perform checks:
    *   Belief Conflict: Check `belief_conflict_log.json` for conflicts related to the current plan (generated by Critic/checker in 21.1).
    *   High Risk: Check Pessimist risk score (using refined model from 23.1) against a threshold.
    *   Archetype Saturation: Check `archetype_saturation_log.json` (from 22.1).
3. **Implement Halt Logic:** If any check indicates self-opposition is warranted (conflict detected, risk too high, archetype saturated), the controller must **halt** execution *before* calling the mutation guard. Log the halt, the specific reason(s) (belief conflict ID, risk score, saturated archetype), and the decision source (self-opposition) to `loop_summary_rejection_log.json` and `loop_justification_log.json`.\n4. **Integration & Test:** Run a loop (`loop_0032`) designed to propose a mutation that triggers one or more self-opposition conditions (e.g., optimize core component conflicting with stability belief B001, high risk, optimize archetype saturated).\n5. **Functional Validation:** Verify `loop_0032` halted *before* `mutation_guard.py` was called (check logs). Verify `loop_summary_rejection_log.json` logs the halt due to self-opposition, citing the specific reason(s).
