  "description": "Executes the fully integrated cognitive loop with functional agents, confirmed LLM reasoning, active governance, comprehensive logging, and live UI visualization, as validated and integrated throughout Phases 21-36. Culminates in the generation of the SaaS vertical scaffold for investor demonstration.",
  "prompt": "Operator Directive: Execute Phase 36.1. Run the complete, integrated Promethios cognitive loop live. Confirm readiness of functional agents, LLM integration, and active governance. Log reflections and justifications thoroughly. Visualize the process via the live UI. Output the final vertical scaffold and cognitive trace artifacts. Goal: Demonstrate a live, thinking, building, and reflecting AI co-founder operating within its actively governed framework.",
