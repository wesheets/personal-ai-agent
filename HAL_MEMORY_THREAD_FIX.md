HAL Memory Thread Fix Documentation

This document explains the issue with the HAL agent's add_memory_thread() function call
and the solution implemented to fix it.

## Problem

The HAL agent was failing with the following error:
`add_memory_thread() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 3 were given`

This error occurred when the HAL agent tried to log a reflection or step result in agent_runner.py.
The add_memory_thread() function expects a single dictionary parameter, but somewhere it was
being called with 3 separate arguments.

## Solution

We implemented a robust solution with the following components:

1. **Safe Wrapper Function**: Created a `safe_add_memory_thread()` wrapper function that:
   - Accepts both dictionary and individual arguments
   - Converts individual arguments to the proper dictionary format
   - Validates required fields and provides defaults for missing ones
   - Includes comprehensive error handling
   - Adds detailed debug logging

2. **Updated Existing Calls**: Modified the HAL agent's log_memory function to use the new
   safe wrapper instead of calling add_memory_thread directly.

3. **Debug Logging**: Added extensive debug logging throughout the process:
   - When using provided dictionary format
   - When converting arguments to dictionary format
   - When detecting missing required fields
   - When successfully writing to memory thread
   - When errors occur

## Implementation Details

The safe_add_memory_thread wrapper function handles several scenarios:

1. If the first argument is already a dictionary, it uses it directly
2. If individual arguments are provided, it converts them to a dictionary
3. It validates that all required fields are present
4. It provides default values for any missing fields
5. It catches and logs any exceptions that occur

This defensive programming approach ensures that all calls to add_memory_thread
will use the correct format, regardless of how they're currently being made.

## Testing

To test this fix:

1. Run the HAL agent with:
   ```json
   {
     "agent_id": "hal",
     "project_id": "demo_001",
     "task": "Continue cognitive build loop"
   }
   ```

2. Verify that:
   - HAL returns 200 OK
   - system/status shows loop_count: 1
   - memory/thread logs the reflection or output from HAL

## Future Improvements

For future improvements, consider:

1. Adding type hints to all memory-related functions
2. Creating a standardized memory logging interface
3. Adding unit tests for the safe wrapper function
4. Implementing a more robust validation system for memory entries
