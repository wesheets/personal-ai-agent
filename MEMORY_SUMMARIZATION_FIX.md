# Memory Summarization Module Fix Documentation

## Issue Identified
The `/api/modules/memory/summarize` endpoint was failing with a `ModuleNotFoundError` despite the code being correctly implemented in the repository.

## Root Cause Analysis
After examining the repository structure and code, we discovered that:
1. The `memory_summarizer.py` file already existed with proper implementation
2. The import statement in `memory.py` was correct
3. The issue was with missing Python dependencies in the environment

## Dependencies Installed
The following dependencies were missing and needed to be installed:
1. `uvicorn` - Required for running the FastAPI server
2. `fastapi` - The web framework used by the application
3. `python-dotenv` - Required for environment variable loading

## Testing
After installing the dependencies, the server started successfully and the `/summarize` endpoint worked correctly:
- Endpoint: `POST http://localhost:8000/api/modules/memory/summarize`
- Test payload: `{"agent_id": "shiva", "type": "training", "limit": 5}`
- Response: `{"status":"ok","summary":"No relevant memories to summarize.","memory_count":0}`

## Conclusion
The issue was not with the code implementation but with the Python environment setup. Installing the required dependencies resolved the problem, allowing the memory summarization module to function as expected.
