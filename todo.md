# Phase 10.0: Orchestrator Instruction Schema Engine Implementation

## Backend Structure
- [ ] Create `/backend` directory at project root
- [ ] Create `instruction_engine.ts` file with Instruction interface
- [ ] Implement instruction_registry data structure

## Data Models
- [ ] Define Instruction interface with all required properties:
  - instruction_id, goal_id, thread_id, agent_id, task_summary, tools_required
  - expected_outputs, loop_enforcement, allow_retry, escalate_on_failure
  - status, last_updated
- [ ] Implement methods for creating instructions
- [ ] Implement methods for updating instruction status
- [ ] Implement validation methods for instructions

## UI Components
- [ ] Create `InstructionPreviewCard.tsx` component
- [ ] Update `AgentSandboxCard.tsx` to include Active Instruction panel
- [ ] Enhance `AgentChat.tsx` to log instruction assignments
- [ ] Add progress indicators for instruction outputs

## Orchestrator Integration
- [ ] Add functionality to generate goal_id
- [ ] Implement instruction object generation
- [ ] Add delegation mechanism to assign instructions to agents
- [ ] Implement logging for instruction creation in chat

## Validation Logic
- [ ] Implement checkpoint enforcement
- [ ] Add reflection enforcement
- [ ] Implement escalation logic for failed validations
- [ ] Add validation for expected outputs

## Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Test instruction creation and assignment
- [ ] Test validation and escalation logic
- [ ] Push changes to GitHub
- [ ] Verify deployment functionality

## Documentation
- [ ] Document instruction schema and usage
- [ ] Notify operator of completed implementation
