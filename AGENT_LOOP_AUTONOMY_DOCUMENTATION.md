Agent Loop Autonomy Core Documentation

This document provides an overview of the Agent Loop Autonomy Core feature
implemented in Phase 6.4 of the Promethios AI Agent project.

## Overview

The Agent Loop Autonomy Core enables Promethios agents to automatically loop, 
delegate, and continue building until a project is complete without manual 
re-triggering. This feature significantly enhances the autonomy of the system
by allowing agents to work together in a continuous loop until a project is
completed or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Key Components

1. **Project State Loop Tracking**
   - Added loop_count, max_loops, and last_completed_agent fields to project state
   - Implemented functions to increment loop count and check if loop should continue
   - Added completed_steps tracking to monitor agent progress

2. **Agent Loop Trigger Mechanism**
   - Created agent_loop_trigger.py module to handle triggering the agent loop
   - Implemented trigger_agent_loop() function to call orchestrator.consult()
   - Added integration with HAL agent to trigger the loop after completion

3. **Loop Exit Conditions**
   - Implemented should_continue_loop() function in project_state.py
   - Added exit conditions: status == "complete" OR loop_count >= max_loops
   - Added consult() method to Orchestrator class to handle loop continuation

4. **Handoff Hints**
   - Added handoff_to field to agent responses
   - Implemented handoff hint handling in trigger_agent_loop()
   - Modified HAL agent to include handoff hint to NOVA

5. **SAGE Reflection Hook**
   - Implemented trigger_sage_reflection() function in agent_loop_trigger.py
   - Added system_routes.py with /summary endpoint for SAGE agent
   - Configured hook to trigger when loop completes

## Usage

The Agent Loop Autonomy Core is automatically activated when an agent completes
its task. No manual intervention is required to trigger the loop. The system will
continue delegating tasks between agents until the project is complete or the
maximum number of loops is reached.

### Configuration

The maximum number of loops can be configured in the project state:

```python
# Set maximum loops to 10
update_project_state(project_id, {"max_loops": 10})
```

### Monitoring

The current loop count and status can be monitored through the project state:

```python
project_state = read_project_state(project_id)
loop_count = project_state.get("loop_count", 0)
max_loops = project_state.get("max_loops", 5)
status = project_state.get("status")
```

## Error Handling

The Agent Loop Autonomy Core includes comprehensive error handling to ensure
robustness:

1. All functions include try-except blocks to catch and log errors
2. Fallbacks are provided when components are unavailable
3. Detailed logging is implemented throughout the system
4. Loop trigger failures are gracefully handled

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the Agent Loop Autonomy Core include:

1. Dynamic adjustment of max_loops based on project complexity
2. More sophisticated agent selection based on project needs
3. Enhanced monitoring and visualization of the agent loop
4. Integration with external notification systems
5. Parallel agent execution for independent tasks

## Conclusion

The Agent Loop Autonomy Core represents a significant advancement in the
autonomy of the Promethios AI Agent system. By enabling continuous delegation
between agents, the system can now complete complex projects with minimal
human intervention.
